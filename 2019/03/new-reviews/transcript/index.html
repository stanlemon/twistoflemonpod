<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:22]</p>
<p>with a twist of lemon.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:24]</p>
<p>Alright, John. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:27]</p>
<p>our last episode</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:29]</p>
<p>stirred a bit of controversy.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:31]</p>
<p>What do you think? Indeed, it did. Shall we call it the Ides of The</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:00:37]</p>
<p>Ides of Starch.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:00:38]</p>
<p>Was anybody stabbed?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:40]</p>
<p>I mean, I I kinda felt a little betrayed by some of our friends who dogged on me for my opinions about grilled cheese sandwiches. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:54]</p>
<p>I don't really blame them, Stan. I see, I feel like I feel like you're a turncoat. You were with me last week when we were having this discussion.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:03]</p>
<p>I was with you on melt versus</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:06]</p>
<p>grilled cheese.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:08]</p>
<p>I would never got on board with the baking the grilled cheese in the oven. Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:14]</p>
<p>So I think the largest or the most frequent it was multiple people</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:21]</p>
<p>sent us messages on various mediums</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:25]</p>
<p>indicating</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:26]</p>
<p>that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:27]</p>
<p>I could not</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:29]</p>
<p>make a grilled cheese in the oven</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:32]</p>
<p>and still,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:35]</p>
<p>how do I say this,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:36]</p>
<p>harp on those who would use Wonder Bread and Kraft cheese.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:41]</p>
<p>I saw one of those comments. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:45]</p>
<p>here's the thing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:46]</p>
<p>I I stand by my original assessment</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:50]</p>
<p>that a grilled cheese sandwich does not need to be on a physical grill. I don't even believe it needs to be on grates, which was the thing that you said.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:00]</p>
<p>Right. I I imagine that most people will make their grilled cheese either in a skillet or on a griddle or something like that. I think that's how the majority of Americans make their grilled cheese. Tell me, Jonathan,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:13]</p>
<p>what is the difference</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:15]</p>
<p>between cooking one in a skillet or a griddle</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:19]</p>
<p>and a hot pan in the oven? What is the difference between those? Because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:24]</p>
<p>I stand by the assessment that they are not fundamentally that different.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:29]</p>
<p>They are a hot surface.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:31]</p>
<p>The the bread</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:33]</p>
<p>has a reaction</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:34]</p>
<p>which causes it to toast,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:37]</p>
<p>and the cheese melts.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:38]</p>
<p>And that is what makes a grilled cheese. Not not the thing you cook it on, but the way that it like, the outcome,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:45]</p>
<p>the chemical products that, are affected on the bread and the cheese.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:53]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:54]</p>
<p>I have a problem with the skill and griddle method as well,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:59]</p>
<p>but I think that it is closer to looking like you're grilling because you stand over the cooking surface and you flip the grilled cheese sandwich,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:08]</p>
<p>hopefully only once.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:10]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:12]</p>
<p>the way that I do it, I use a hot pan on the top and the bottom so that I don't have to flip it. Right. So you don't need to flip it. But is is the act of flipping what defines the the thing you eat?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:25]</p>
<p>No. I think that it just theirs is closer to like you would do it on a grill. K.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:32]</p>
<p>But but again,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:33]</p>
<p>when you eat a grilled cheese sandwich, I I I would contend</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:38]</p>
<p>it is not defined</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:39]</p>
<p>by the method in which it's cooked, but by the outcome</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:43]</p>
<p>of the bread and the cheese. Right? It's toasted,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:48]</p>
<p>and it's melted.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:54]</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:56]</p>
<p>I will agree that we can call that grilled cheese.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:59]</p>
<p>Now it's a question of the optimal way to make that cheese. And that's that's a different thing. I just let's be I wanna be crystal clear</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:07]</p>
<p>that you have agreed</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:09]</p>
<p>that what I produce in the oven with my method is a grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:14]</p>
<p>Correct. But by that method, Wonder Bread and Kraft singles are also a grilled cheese. No.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:22]</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:23]</p>
<p>Yes. Okay. First of all, Kraft cheese is not cheese.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:26]</p>
<p>That was part of the point that I made last week. Kraft cheese is soy product.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:34]</p>
<p>But it says cheese on the packaging. John, I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:39]</p>
<p>on my name tag, I could write a duck. It doesn't make me a duck. I'm still a human. Right? Like, just because you say something is a thing does not make it so.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:48]</p>
<p>But their whole marketing campaign is around it being cheese. I I believe that Kraft makes products that are cheese.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:55]</p>
<p>Kraft singles are not one of them. And, actually, I'm pretty sure let's I'm a test this. If I if I Google</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:03]</p>
<p>Kraft because it's not Kraft cheese singles,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:06]</p>
<p>it's Kraft singles. It's not. Right? And I'm I'm pretty sure that's by design.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:13]</p>
<p>Interesting. Yeah. Singles. Kraft recipes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:17]</p>
<p>Fine. Yeah. Craft sing Then choose your</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:20]</p>
<p>your random grocery store brand</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:24]</p>
<p>American cheese slices. I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:27]</p>
<p>love it. The craft singles, they've got a actual picture of a grilled cheese sandwich on it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:32]</p>
<p>Because I would never buy name brand cheese anyway.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:35]</p>
<p>Reduced fat pasteurized prepared cheese</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:38]</p>
<p>product.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:40]</p>
<p>Cheese product. Cheese product.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:42]</p>
<p>What's the difference between a cheese product and cheese? Cheese product is not cheese. Otherwise, they wouldn't put the word product at the end of it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:50]</p>
<p>But why do they keep the word cheese? Because they want you to think that it is like cheese. It is similar to cheese. It might taste like cheese. It's suggestive, John. If you think it's cheese, maybe they'll make It it is basically</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:05]</p>
<p>all of what is wrong with America summarized up in a little plastic wrapper.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:11]</p>
<p>Fair enough. It is it is I agree with you on that point.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:15]</p>
<p>I really didn't expect to get upset. And and The rest you really The rest of the grilled cheese the rest of the grilled cheese debate, I'm gonna wash my hands off. We'll leave it up to our listeners.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:25]</p>
<p>Comment</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:26]</p>
<p>on the Facebook post.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:28]</p>
<p>Do you agree with Stan, or do you not agree with Stan? First,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:32]</p>
<p>on his method of grilling cheese.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:35]</p>
<p>Second,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:37]</p>
<p>on the Kraft singles conversation.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:40]</p>
<p>Just to be clear, life with a twist of lemon does not recommend</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:44]</p>
<p>craft singles for</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:46]</p>
<p>anything. We also don't recommend Wonder Bread, which is the third point that we could pull people on. Like, in what world is Wonder Bread acceptable for a sandwich, John?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:58]</p>
<p>I don't know. I haven't bought it. I can't remember the last time I had it. I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:03]</p>
<p>just don't I I think that we need a taste test.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:07]</p>
<p>Instead of our milkshake reviews. We might have to go to grilled cheese reviews. Unfortunately,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:12]</p>
<p>it would be the ones that we make. So You can get grilled cheese sandwiches in restaurants.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:17]</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Totally. Are any of them good? Are you kidding me? You absolutely can.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:21]</p>
<p>You're gonna start looking for them now. Interesting. But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:24]</p>
<p>I don't know that I want to spend money on a grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:29]</p>
<p>I I'm not confident that the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:31]</p>
<p>product, pun intended, that they use in their sandwiches is something that I really wanna be putting into my body. And,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:38]</p>
<p>I am being a cheese snob.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:41]</p>
<p>If you'd even call that maybe you could call it a cheese You're angry, Stan. Snob.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:46]</p>
<p>I'm not You're very, very angry.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:48]</p>
<p>You're angry about grilled cheese. How often do you eat grilled cheese?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:52]</p>
<p>That's a good question. I'd say once a month.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:55]</p>
<p>Yeah. I'm I might be there, but probably less So the thing the thing is, like, grilled cheese sandwich is easy, especially when you bake a bunch of them in the oven</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:04]</p>
<p>using my method.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:06]</p>
<p>It's not my method. I think I got it from, like, America's Test Kitchen or something like that, which you would think Got it. Having this conversation</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:14]</p>
<p>that that would make it more acceptable to you, John.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:18]</p>
<p>America's Test Kitchen doesn't exist anymore. It just does, John. Just the podcast doesn't exist.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:24]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:25]</p>
<p>it's dead to me.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:27]</p>
<p>I have I have no words for you. Anyways, we need to cheer you up, Stan. I'm moving on from the grilled cheese conversation. Move on. Our our listeners can fight with you if they want. I just</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:37]</p>
<p>I'm not that invested. A grilled cheese is a grilled cheese. The best grilled cheese probably isn't gonna be that much better than the worst grilled cheese I've ever had. So so</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:50]</p>
<p>things to make Stan happy.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:52]</p>
<p>We have</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:54]</p>

<p>You happy now, Stan? We're recording late. I'm tired. Low energy level,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:45]</p>
<p>but we'll make it through. We got this.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:49]</p>
<p>Alright. You had, some insight into boosting Facebook posts.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:53]</p>
<p>Indeed. So you remember that Captain Marvel bonus episode?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:57]</p>
<p>Yeah. That was a that was a great episode.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:59]</p>
<p>It was worthy of being boosted on Facebook. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:04]</p>
<p>Worth dropping $10?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:06]</p>
<p>It's it's was worth dropping 10 of your bucks.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:10]</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:11]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:12]</p>
<p>I put $10 to boost that post over the week following the release of Captain Marvel,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:19]</p>
<p>and I learned some things along the way.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:21]</p>
<p>Boosting posts</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:23]</p>
<p>really helps the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:25]</p>
<p>post like count.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:28]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:29]</p>
<p>final tally after that campaign ended was 197</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:33]</p>
<p>reactions.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:34]</p>
<p>I think our next highest post is probably around</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:38]</p>
<ol start="10">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:40]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:42]</p>
<p>so that was solid.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:44]</p>
<p>Facebook has this cool thing where people who have liked your post, you can invite them to like your page.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:50]</p>
<p>Of those 197</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:52]</p>
<p>reactions, I guess some of those were organic,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:55]</p>
<p>so</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:56]</p>
<p>these numbers aren't exact.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:58]</p>
<p>One person accepted the invite to like the life with a twist of lemon Facebook page.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:05]</p>
<p>Hi. Any improvement in listenership?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:09]</p>
<p>So this is weird,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:12]</p>
<p>and I don't know if it's correlation or causation.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:17]</p>
<p>So, like, the first 17 episodes</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:21]</p>
<p>got a whole bunch of downloads.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:24]</p>
<p>The Captain Marvel episode,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:26]</p>
<p>pretty much par for the course. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:30]</p>
<p>kinda weird. We didn't get a ton of people who clicked on the link through the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:36]</p>
<p>Facebook ad,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:37]</p>
<p>which seems bad,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:40]</p>
<p>but there were some. This just goes to show that we know nothing about digital marketing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:46]</p>
<p>But we're learning, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:51]</p>
<p>I should've had better marketing copy in our post, but I didn't know I was gonna boost the post originally. You got you got 10 more bucks? I mean, keep trying.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:02]</p>
<p>Nope. I'm all out for this month, Stan. Maybe for the Avengers episode. Oh. There we go. We'll have to figure out I mean, maybe</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:10]</p>
<p>we just need to tell them to click. Like, did we actually say click?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:15]</p>
<p>I don't think so. Yeah. See, think you need to use the word click. That seems up. It was a bad</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:20]</p>
<p>badly written post.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:23]</p>
<p>Alright, John. Also interesting,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:25]</p>
<p>Captain Marvel movie,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:27]</p>
<p>female heroine.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:29]</p>
<p>The audience of people, the 1,176</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:32]</p>
<p>people that this sponsored boosted post was shown to,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:36]</p>
<p>13.9%</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:37]</p>
<p>of them were women. 86.1</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:40]</p>
<p>of them were men.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:43]</p>
<p>I targeted a bunch of Marvel related interests,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:46]</p>
<p>so that's not super surprising.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:49]</p>
<p>But it's also a little bit surprising because I think that there are probably more</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:16:54]</p>
<p>women than men who are actively using Facebook.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:58]</p>
<p>Really? I don't know. I feel like women have more important things to be doing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:04]</p>
<p>Maybe? I don't know. I don't know. I guess this is probably something we can look up. Yeah. I'm afraid I'm afraid that our analysis would just be</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:13]</p>
<p>absurd and preposterous.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:17]</p>
<p>True. Alright,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:19]</p>
<p>John.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:20]</p>
<p>Suffice to say,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:22]</p>
<p>those who like the post, thank you. You're probably not listening to the podcast, but thank you nonetheless.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:28]</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:30]</p>
<p>And if you have now seen Captain Marvel and you missed the bonus round that we put out,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:35]</p>
<p>the Saturday after Captain Marvel came out,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:38]</p>
<p>go back and listen. It's what, two episodes back in the feed?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:43]</p>
<p>Yeah. I I I think it's a good episode. There's some analysis. There's a lot of spoilers,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:47]</p>
<p>is why maybe not everybody jumped on the bandwagon. But if you're listening to this and you've now seen the movie, go for it. If you haven't seen the movie and you don't plan to, it's also worth listening to quite frankly. I I really enjoyed listening to it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:00]</p>
<p>So early on,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:01]</p>
<p>it might have been Ant Man and the Wasp. We did an episode on that,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:05]</p>
<p>and one of your coworkers</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:08]</p>
<p>commented and said,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:09]</p>
<p>I can't believe I just listened to Lemon talk about Marvel movies for half an hour. Oh, yeah. That was my friend Stevie in Japan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:17]</p>
<p>He he just doesn't watch Marvel movies, but he listened to the episode anyway. Yeah. Don't think he still listens.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:23]</p>
<p>Oh, man. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:26]</p>
<p>So, John, I think one this is an interesting segue. Right?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:31]</p>
<p>Do most people listen to every episode of a podcast</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:34]</p>
<p>or periodically pick one when they need something to listen to? And I think it's mostly the latter.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:40]</p>
<p>I think there are you know, you've got people probably like you and me, are podcast completionists.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:45]</p>
<p>Right? We subscribe to something. We listen to all of it, and we kinda make a routine out of it. And and, you know, some people, like, they get in their car. Right? They play the next podcast</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:54]</p>
<p>on their player, whatever, as they're driving to work. Yeah. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:59]</p>
<p>Those folks, like, they're probably gonna catch every episode, but we're not a daily podcast, so we're not I I think there's less appeal to those folks. I think those folks tend to listen to something that's constantly available. At least it's a hypothesis of mine. I I've not actually ever listened to podcasts</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:14]</p>
<p>while commuting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:15]</p>
<p>I haven't actually commuted in</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:18]</p>
<p>probably six or seven years.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:21]</p>
<p>You move from the bedroom to your office, Dan. Yeah. But What is that? 20 steps?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:27]</p>
<ol start="24">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:28]</p>
<p>But if you remember, there was a period of time which I commuted into the office,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:32]</p>
<p>and Right. I even worked for a podcast company, like a podcast hosting company, and I did not listen to podcasts at the time. I did listen to the radio,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:41]</p>
<p>but I didn't listen to podcasts.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:43]</p>
<p>With the commercials and everything? Yeah. The whole shebang. Listened to,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:48]</p>
<p>like, sports commentary, basically, on the way in. That sounds terrible, Stan. I enjoyed it. Like, it was I'm sorry that we didn't have a podcast for you to listen to.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:57]</p>
<p>Well, this is this is a while ago, John. But, yeah, I listened to like Pittsburgh Pirates analysis and things of that sort, so I enjoyed it. But, you know, that was only it was like start off as a thirty minute drive, then my next job was an hour drive, and, you know, it is what it is.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:13]</p>
<p>I think we have several people that we are the only podcast that they listen to. I like that. I like that. They're probably wondering why they're listening to us right now having Well, two of them are because they're mothers of the hosts.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:29]</p>
<p>Anyway, hey, listeners. You're listening.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:32]</p>
<p>We have a contact form on our website and a Facebook page. Tell us. Do you listen to every episode, or do you only choose the ones that you wanna listen to based on whatever title I come up with for the episode?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:45]</p>
<p>It's always a surprise to me. I enjoy it when that push notification comes through.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:50]</p>
<p>Alright,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:52]</p>
<p>Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:54]</p>
<p>We're back to milkshakes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:55]</p>
<p>We are. I thought we were done with milkshakes, John.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:59]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:00]</p>
<p>But I think we've started a movement.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:02]</p>
<p>This is how Movement. Stan Lemon Stan Lemon and John Kollmeyer can change the world</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:08]</p>
<p>by promoting</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:09]</p>
<p>good milkshakes and good craftsmanship</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:12]</p>
<p>in milkshake making. Go on, John. Tell me more.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:17]</p>
<p>There have been several people now.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:21]</p>
<p>One this week,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:23]</p>
<p>who will send me pictures of either themselves</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:26]</p>
<p>or their children</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:28]</p>
<p>consuming milkshakes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:30]</p>
<p>Do they come with analysis</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:32]</p>
<p>of the milkshake's slurpability and consistency?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:37]</p>
<p>Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:38]</p>
<p>I So when my dad I when my dad sent his</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:42]</p>
<p>milkshake picture,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:45]</p>
<p>he provided the full commentary. Nice. It would be a a good guest to have on the podcast to talk about milkshakes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:52]</p>
<p>Now when it's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:54]</p>
<p>children,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:56]</p>
<p>their parents are sending pictures,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:59]</p>
<p>not as much analysis there.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:01]</p>
<p>Definitely no Lucy Lemon</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:04]</p>
<p>analysis.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:06]</p>
<p>Henry's still jealous that he has not had a chance to leave his feedback. That's because now we're recording after my bedtime stand. Henry would never make it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:15]</p>
<p>He's probably awake right now flipping through a Pokemon book.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:20]</p>
<p>Are you gonna take him to see the Pokemon movie? I don't know. That's a good question. I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:24]</p>
<p>am not sure what I'm getting into there.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:28]</p>
<p>I it definitely won't be an opening day kind of thing. We'll take a look at reviews and all that. I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:33]</p>
<p>Ryan Reynolds is in that, if I recall.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:36]</p>
<p>And I'm one, I'm not a big Ryan Reynolds fan. And two,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:41]</p>
<p>he he tends</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:43]</p>
<p>to have an</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:44]</p>
<p>unsavory interpretation</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:45]</p>
<p>of characters.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:47]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:48]</p>
<p>I don't really wanna ruin Pokemon for my son,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:52]</p>
<p>like, as a character. Right? So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:55]</p>
<p>we'll we'll see. I'll leave it at that. If it Do you have the old animated series somewhere he's been watching? Oh, dude. It's on Amazon Prime. He's he's watched a ton of episodes. Nice. He also, though, he's got books,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:07]</p>
<p>and he reads those with, like, stories about Pokemon in them all the time.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:13]</p>
<p>And, I mean, he's just totally immersed. It's funny because I didn't I was never into Pokemon. It wasn't my thing. Right. I don't remember ever having Pokemon cards.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:22]</p>
<p>He got a box set from his uncle</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:25]</p>
<p>as a gift for a birthday.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:27]</p>
<p>Didn't do much with them until we moved into this house and then started trading them with kids in the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:33]</p>
<p>And now Yeah. He's like he's up to the nines</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:36]</p>
<p>with Pokemon stuff</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:38]</p>
<p>and and he's constantly trading.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:42]</p>
<p>So the Pokemon card game</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:45]</p>
<p>became big</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:46]</p>
<p>when I was in, like, third, fourth grade,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:49]</p>
<p>and I hadn't really heard anything else about it until</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:54]</p>
<p>really Pokemon Go, I think,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:57]</p>
<p>probably reignited</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:58]</p>
<p>it being on my radar.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:00]</p>
<p>Yeah. I never played the game. Did you play the game? I played it. I remember Patrick Sturtevant and I were driving around Texas or something like that catching Pokemon.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:10]</p>
<p>I never played the card game originally,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:13]</p>
<p>and I only watch some of the animated series,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:16]</p>
<p>like, sporadically.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:18]</p>
<p>It it still amazes me. Pokemon GO has a strong following.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:21]</p>
<p>Again, this is just not my thing. I I'm not knocking it. I I just don't</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:26]</p>
<p>it's different. Right? So,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:28]</p>
<p>I will be in San Francisco next week for work</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:31]</p>
<p>and or this week when this comes out.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:34]</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:35]</p>
<p>I will have colleagues who will be doing, like, Pokemon GO raids</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:39]</p>
<p>while we're in San Francisco, which is right. It's it's cool. I dig it. Like, what have you, but it's it's different. And I I Henry's not gotten into the Pokemon GO</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:49]</p>
<p>side out of the house. He there's a Pokemon app that is basically the card game, like, played out, and he has played that. And Pokemon decks now come with</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:58]</p>
<p>points, like, cards that you can use to get points on the online version.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:25:05]</p>
<p>Interesting. So the killer for Pokemon GO for me was that the app was just a resource hog. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:25:13]</p>
<p>And it was slow,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:14]</p>
<p>and it would drain my battery. So Well, you know, it's didn't last very long. It's interesting. That app came out before, like, AR</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:22]</p>
<p>was a first class citizen on the iPhone, and now it is. And I don't know. I I presume they've updated it. Right? But that whole</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:29]</p>
<p>it it was it was really kinda</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:32]</p>
<p>pioneering</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:33]</p>
<p>that way of playing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:35]</p>
<p>Interesting is if I recall, Nintendo</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:38]</p>
<p>licensed out</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:40]</p>
<p>another company's IP or had them develop Pokemon GO. It was loosely based off of another app that they had previously done. So it wasn't like Nintendo originated the idea, but I think Pokemon GO kind of took this whole augmented reality</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:53]</p>
<p>gameplay mindset and put it in everybody's head. And Right. Yeah. And I'm like, that's cool. I dig it. I think I think AR has got some interesting,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:03]</p>
<p>you know, potential.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:05]</p>
<p>I I think, by and large, when you, like, download the IKEA app and you or the Wayfair app. Actually, that's a better example. The Wayfair app where you plop a couch in your living room, that largely is not helpful and just looks cheesy, in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:19]</p>
<p>But the Pokemon GO stuff, thought was was cool and well done. I mean, at least from what I saw.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:26:24]</p>
<p>This is one of those topics that we're talking about that I never thought we would have talked about on the podcast. The Pokemon GO or augmented reality?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:26:32]</p>
<p>Pokemon</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:33]</p>
<p>at all. You brought it up. You brought up. I mean I did.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:26:37]</p>
<p>Just because I saw the trailer before Captain Marvel. Oh, interesting. So Speaking of trailers,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:26:43]</p>
<p>are we gonna let this episode pass without talking about Avengers Endgame? It's not on the list. Was there was there a new trailer out?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:50]</p>
<p>Yes. There was. Patrick sent it to us. I'm just kidding. I watched it. What did did you make of it? This trailer was interesting because there were a bunch of clips from older movies.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:59]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:03]</p>
<p>I don't know how to put into words what I made of it. It just has me super</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:09]</p>
<p>excited</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:10]</p>
<p>for the movie to come out. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:13]</p>
<p>the I my suspicion is that the clips</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:17]</p>
<p>that we saw will not actually be in the movie.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:21]</p>
<p>K. I think that they are merely to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:24]</p>
<p>do some,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:26]</p>
<p>like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:27]</p>
<p>connective tissue, if you will, between the stories of old. Right? They kinda, like, pull at the heartstrings.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:35]</p>
<p>The</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:36]</p>
<p>the rest of it, think, is is good. It's exciting. Right? One of the things that interests me maybe the most are those crazy suits at the end.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:44]</p>
<p>Did you Which catch I did, but I didn't understand what they were until I saw you and Patrick talking about them. Yeah. So Patrick and I have this theory that those are tied to the quantum realm.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:55]</p>
<p>I can't come up with another explanation than that. I I I just I don't think they're purely</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:01]</p>
<p>necessary for space because these characters have been in and out of space without special suits, you know, quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:09]</p>
<p>And so my suspicion is they need them to go into the quantum realm to change whatever it is that, they need to change,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:18]</p>
<p>which again, this goes back to my theory that the quantum realm is gonna play a really big part in this next movie.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:24]</p>
<p>And, you know, that all comes off of my Ant Man of the Wasp post credit scene</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:28]</p>
<p>stuff.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:30]</p>
<p>Is that how they saved Tony Stark?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:34]</p>
<p>I I don't know. I mean, it so I will say one thing about this movie. Did you get the sense that everybody's gonna die?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:42]</p>
<p>Kind of. Yeah. But half of them die died already. Yeah. But I I mean, like, give some finality to it. So I keep wondering,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:51]</p>
<p>all of these characters appear to be out of contract. Right? They appear to be moving on to other projects.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:57]</p>
<p>So have we seen the last of of,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:01]</p>
<p>Robert Downey junior as Iron Man? I'm inclined to think maybe.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:05]</p>
<p>Right? Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:07]</p>
<p>Same with Thor.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:09]</p>
<p>That's Chris Hemsworth, and then the Hulk,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:12]</p>
<p>and,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:13]</p>
<p>oh my gosh. What is Captain America's what's that actor's name?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:19]</p>
<p>I should know us. Well, that guy. So that's kinda sad to me. I think there's gonna be some finality. I think that's kinda what this trailer teased. I did think, and,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:28]</p>
<p>this is I thought it was pretty cool, was that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:31]</p>
<p>post</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:32]</p>
<p>trailer scene</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:34]</p>
<p>with Thor and Captain Marvel.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:37]</p>
<p>I really enjoyed that. I thought that was well So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:40]</p>
<p>I'm this</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:41]</p>
<p>that's probably having now seen Captain Marvel, I think her role inside of Endgame is maybe the thing I am the most excited about.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:51]</p>
<p>How much of a role do you think that will be? I think Do think that she's the main character there? I I think she is. Well,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:58]</p>
<p>in these Avengers movies, you don't ever have a main character. Right? Right. You have a couple of characters that are stronger than the others. So as an example, right, Captain America, Thor,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:09]</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:11]</p>
<p>Iron Man. Right? Those have been historically the three mains, and everybody else is augmented in some capacity. Right. My suspicion</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:20]</p>
<p>is that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:21]</p>
<p>she will be</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:22]</p>
<p>the, like, the center, and you will have a couple of the other characters, maybe Ant Man,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:29]</p>
<p>although I'm not entirely sure about that, step up as, like, you know, kinda her co leads.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:35]</p>
<p>But I I believe the next decade</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:38]</p>
<p>that's where everything goes? Yeah. Yeah. With k. The so she's gonna rally who's ever left to do the job that the three that are on their way out couldn't do. That's that's kinda my hunch. I will say this. I think that she defines the next decade of Marvel.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:53]</p>
<p>Right? K. And so Now, there there's a Doctor Strange</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:58]</p>
<p>two</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:59]</p>
<p>Yep. That is in production,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:31:01]</p>
<p>or something like that? Something like that. K. But it's confirmed. And</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:06]</p>
<p>a Guardians three as well.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:08]</p>
<p>So I don't know that I don't know how long Guardians last. I think Doctor Strange is one of those characters that Marvel could draw on more. I think Black Panther is gonna probably</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:17]</p>
<p>now he's gone. Right? So he he</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:20]</p>
<p>Right. Was part of the snappening.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:22]</p>
<p>But I think he's another character Snappening. Yeah. The snappening.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:27]</p>
<p>He's another character that I think that Marvel can continue to build around. And so</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:31]</p>
<p>we'll see. Like, I quite frankly,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:34]</p>
<p>I wanna live in the Marvel Cinematic Universe that is Captain Marvel,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:37]</p>
<p>Ant Man, Black Panther. Right? Like, that that sounds exciting to me.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:42]</p>
<p>Nice. If Guardians can continue to have another big</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:31:46]</p>
<p>imprint, I think that'd be awesome. Other interesting news They have to recover from Guardians two? Yeah. Right. Especially. Well, other interesting news. I mean, this is kinda related to that. Right? That guy who wrote Guardians one and Guardians two got fired because of some seriously questionable</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:01]</p>
<p>let's not don't even call it questionable.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:03]</p>
<p>Very poor tastefully</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:05]</p>
<p>done tweets</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:07]</p>
<p>is apparently not back. So I guess Disney changed their mind on how poor taste they were. I don't know. That that part bothers me a little bit. But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:15]</p>
<p>he he wrote a great first Guardians. He wrote a great first third to first half of Guardians two. So maybe he can make a good Guardians three.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:32:25]</p>
<p>Then We'll see. Also, interestingly,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:28]</p>
<p>Patrick and I talked a little bit about this this week.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:30]</p>
<p>It looks to me like Hawkeye</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:32]</p>
<p>Hawkeye. Gosh.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:35]</p>
<p>Is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:36]</p>
<p>is it Hawkeye, or is it just the hawk? No. It's Hawkeye. It's Hawkeye. Yeah. I'm losing my mind here. Hawkeye,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:41]</p>
<p>was wearing the Ronin costume</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:44]</p>
<p>there in that scene. Like, we got in the Endgame trailer a little more of a view of it, and there's this one scene</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:51]</p>
<p>where he is shooting a bow and arrow with his daughter.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:32:54]</p>
<p>At least I presume that's his daughter. So my suspicion is that he lost some people in the snappening, probably that daughter that they alluded to. And I think that's why the Ronin costume comes out. And the Ronin costume is like this</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:06]</p>
<p>dark thing</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:07]</p>
<p>in the Marvel cinematic or excuse me, the Marvel Universe, rather. It's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:12]</p>
<p>you've got these good guys struggling with</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:15]</p>
<p>dark things,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:16]</p>
<p>and I think that's another</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:18]</p>
<p>exciting angle for this film.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:21]</p>
<p>I would love to see a standalone Hawkeye movie. I would love it. Yep. I'm not sure they'll do it, but I would love it. Also love a standalone Black Widow, to be honest with you. Absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:30]</p>
<p>Is she out of contract now too? I don't know. You know, I read something</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:34]</p>
<p>about was it Ultron,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:36]</p>
<p>maybe? That she negotiated the second largest contract on that movie.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:41]</p>
<p>Nice. Yeah. Which is wild, though. Like, when you think about Right. Her screen time in comparison.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:46]</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:47]</p>
<p>you know, I've like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:49]</p>
<p>I don't know, man. Endgame's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:33:51]</p>
<p>last trailer looks awesome. I can't wait to buy tickets. I can't wait to go see it. I can't wait to do analysis on this podcast with you and Patrick and hopefully pastor Borgart.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:00]</p>

<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:02]</p>

<p>if the endgame tickets become available and I do not have an itinerary from him,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:12]</p>
<p>I will not be buying him a ticket.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:14]</p>
<p>That means he'll have to sit by himself if he wants to come. Yeah. Well Which might not be a terrible thing.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:34:21]</p>
<p>I wanna sit next to him.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:34:25]</p>
