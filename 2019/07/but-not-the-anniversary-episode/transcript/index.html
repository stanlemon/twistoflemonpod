<p>Pastor George Borchardt.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:33]</p>
<p>Nope. No. I can't say that I ran into him.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:00:37]</p>
<p>I don't know. Who comes to Indiana, Stan?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:42]</p>
<p>Maybe</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:43]</p>
<p>a mister and missus Kolmeier.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:00:46]</p>
<p>I was not there,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:00:48]</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure Anna was No. You were not.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:52]</p>
<p>But your parents were, John. Your parents were.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:00:55]</p>
<p>And you you know where I ran into them? Where'd you run into them?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:00]</p>
<p>The one, the only Wileepalooza.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:04]</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:05]</p>
<p>That means And you know what they ordered?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:08]</p>
<p>Milkshakes,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:09]</p>
<p>obviously.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:11]</p>
<p>Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:16]</p>
<p>Do we get some</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:18]</p>
<p>referral</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:19]</p>
<p>kickback from Wileepalooza?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:21]</p>
<p>Because that's two customers they wouldn't have had if not for the life of the Twist Lumber podcast.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:27]</p>
<p>We we don't, but we definitely should. Like, I I think that,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:30]</p>
<p>if by some miracle, anyone from Wileepalooza is listening to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:34]</p>
<p>our podcast,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:36]</p>
<p>at the very least, you should give us free milkshakes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:01:39]</p>
<p>Or even just share a link to our website on your social media profiles.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:44]</p>
<p>There you go. I'll take that. I'll definitely do that. But,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:48]</p>
<p>so your your parents were in town. They contacted us, and we met them</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:53]</p>
<p>at Wileepalooza.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:01:55]</p>
<p>They had a milkshake. I just got ice cream. That's kinda lame. I was buying for the whole family. So,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:00]</p>
<p>you know. Got it. But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:02]</p>
<p>got to hang out and chat with them a little bit, you know.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:05]</p>
<p>It was a good time.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:07]</p>
<p>Yeah. They were making their way back from Kentucky,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:11]</p>
<p>and then they went up to the Air Force Museum</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:15]</p>
<p>on my recommendation be also because of you, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:19]</p>
<p>Hey. I tell you what, that's a great place to go. If, you are listening to this podcast and you've never been to the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:26]</p>
<p>US Air Force Museum</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:29]</p>
<p>in Dayton, Ohio</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:31]</p>
<p>near Wright Patterson Air Force Base, you should absolutely go.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:34]</p>
<p>I don't think I mean, you tell me, John. Is it possible to put into words</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:39]</p>
<p>the experience without actually being there? No, man. It was completely awesome, and they let you in for free.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:02:46]</p>
<p>So there's really no excuse. Yep. These comments are all directed at you, Mark Buto, because you will love this place and spend a week there.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:02:56]</p>
<p>Yeah. It's it's one of those things where I can tell you that there are a lot of planes. There are a lot of cool planes,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:01]</p>
<p>but you really can't wrap your head around just how many cool planes there are all in one place or just the size</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:09]</p>
<p>of the whole outfit. And, yeah, a 100% free. I've taken my kids there a number of times. My,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:15]</p>
<p>folks took me there when I was a kid, so, you know, it's it's a good deal.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:19]</p>
<p>There is a stealth bomber.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:22]</p>
<p>There is. I walked through</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:24]</p>
<p>multiple planes that have served as air force one through the years.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:29]</p>
<p>Including the one that carried, JFK's body back from from Dallas. Yep.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:35]</p>
<p>So cool place. You should</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:37]</p>
<p>take a trip to Ohio. Go</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:39]</p>
<p>hit up Cedar Point, then head south to Dayton, and check out the air force museum.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:44]</p>
<p>Cedar Point is a place that I have actually never been, John. Do you like roller coasters?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:03:48]</p>
<p>I love roller coasters, and I've never been on a roller coaster with John Colmire, and I think that problem probably should be fixed. Yeah. I wonder, can we record</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:57]</p>
<p>while on a roller coaster?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:03:59]</p>
<p>We'd have to figure out how to do that safely.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:01]</p>
<p>Yeah. Probably not according to the rules, but I'm sure we could figure something out. No GoPro's allowed.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:08]</p>
<p>Yeah. I I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:11]</p>
<p>Alright. Cedar Point is now on our bucket list.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:15]</p>
<p>There you go. Alright. So I did not have a milkshake. Did you have a milkshake? I did not have a milkshake.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:21]</p>
<p>If you can't tell from my voice currently, you will by the end of the episode.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:25]</p>
<p>I'm going hoarse. I'm losing my voice,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:28]</p>
<p>So I've avoided</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:29]</p>
<p>dairy and cold things for the most part, and I've gone to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:34]</p>
<p>my grandma Bruning's advice,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:36]</p>
<p>and I'm drinking bourbon.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:40]</p>
<p>Bourbon. Just straight bourbon, or do you have anything going on with it? That is straight bourbon, Basil Hayden's,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:46]</p>
<p>which is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:47]</p>
<p>Papa Buto's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:49]</p>
<p>favorite</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:04:50]</p>
<p>bourbon and really the only one he drinks.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:04:53]</p>
<p>Not not a bad choice. I would say when my throat is sore, John, I like to do a hot toddy. Are you familiar with the hot toddy? Yes. Missus Lemon has made me one before.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:04]</p>
<p>Yeah. See, there you go. So after you're done with that basil Hayden, you can mix up a hot toddy and enjoy that and call it medicinal. Right.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:14]</p>
<p>So no milkshakes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:16]</p>
<p>No milkshakes, which I think we said we were gonna do. I got closer than you did, but at the end of the day, it was our dear listeners,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:23]</p>
<p>the coal Myers coal Myers the elder that managed</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:28]</p>
<p>to to get get a milkshake in this week. And came to visit Indianapolis.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:33]</p>
<p>Yeah. It was a good time. Good time.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:35]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:36]</p>
<p>on that note though, I think I'm I kinda dodged the big news. Right? Kind</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:42]</p>
<p>of. I mean, you put this here. This is episode 52,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:47]</p>
<p>which theoretically</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:48]</p>
<p>is a year of life with twist of lemon.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:52]</p>
<p>In actuality,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:54]</p>
<p>we're close,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:05:55]</p>
<p>but not quite there.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:05:57]</p>
<p>Do we determine what the release date of episode one is? I believe it is July</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:02]</p>
<ol start="31">
<li></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:04]</p>
<p>No. That's not true because I staggered them by dates even though I posted them all at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:10]</p>
<p>This math doesn't work. I don't even know what to do with my phone. So when we kicked off life with the twist of lemon, we released three episodes out of the gate.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:21]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:22]</p>
<p>kind of spread them across a couple days via the posting dates. So July 30 is the date for episode one. July 31 is episode two,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:32]</p>
<p>and August 1 is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:35]</p>
<p>episode three.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:36]</p>
<p>So three days, three episodes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:40]</p>
<p>So that throws it off a little bit. And then</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:43]</p>
<p>there is one bonus round episode</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:46]</p>
<p>that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:47]</p>
<p>acted like an episode. So we gave it an episode number</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:51]</p>
<p>rather than the first bonus round, which was really</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:06:54]</p>
<p>us just recreating the conversation we had after we signed off the first time.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:06:59]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:01]</p>
<p>you're telling me that I need to wait, what, one, two, three episodes after this one</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:08]</p>
<p>before I can celebrate a year of Life of the Twisted Lemon?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:12]</p>
<p>I believe so.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:15]</p>
<p>Man, you're such a killjoy.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:17]</p>
<p>So this one, I guess we're gonna release it on the fourth because fourth is Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:23]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:24]</p>
<p>then we'll have episode 53, 54, 55.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:28]</p>
<p>Technically,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:29]</p>
<p>episode 56</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:30]</p>
<p>would fall</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:31]</p>
<p>and kick off the New Year.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:34]</p>
<p>This is just so confusing, John. I don't even know what to do. Alright. So I will hold back the excitement,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:07:40]</p>
<p>and I will put put that in a little bucket, and we'll save it for later. Exit 56</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:07:46]</p>
<p>will be the Anniversary episode. Anniversary episode. Yeah. You get killjoy u. Sorry, man. But you do have something to be excited about, Stan. You posted this vague photo of you and missus Lemon standing outside your house holding</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:02]</p>
<p>what our listeners will know of as the mortgage tracker sheet because it was this it looked like your house. It was colored in on grid paper.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:12]</p>
<p>So tell us your news, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:14]</p>
<p>Yeah. So I I don't even remember which episode It was early, man. We talked about this. It was. It was a long time ago. And I actually blogged about it, and I posted</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:23]</p>
<p>a picture</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:24]</p>
<p>on the blog article.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:27]</p>
<p>Let me see. So this is September 2018.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:08:29]</p>
<p>So shortly after we began.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:32]</p>
<p>Yeah. It was pretty early on. Episode eight of Life With a Twisted Lemon for those that are playing at home and you wanna go back and listen to that great episode. Actually, is that was that one of the hot episodes that got a lot of listeners? Yes. I believe that is our most listened to episode to date.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:50]</p>
<p>Well, dear listener, you motivated me. Now so,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:53]</p>
<p>yeah. We paid off the balance of the mortgage, and then</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:57]</p>
<p>as we're,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:08:59]</p>
<p>like, sitting thinking about it, I was like, well, we should get a picture. Because, you know, moments like this always happen and then we never have a picture. Right. And I've got a nine year old. She's capable of taking a picture. So we strolled outside, and I think Lucy did a pretty good job with the iPhone camera. Do you looks nice. Might add it to this episode if I think about it when I'm posting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:20]</p>
<p>There you go. So, yeah, she took that, and now I've got that captured away. And next month, I won't have a mortgage payment, and that's the the first time in thirteen years of homeownership.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:31]</p>
<p>So I I don't know. I don't even know what I'm gonna do.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:34]</p>
<p>Yeah. So this is really,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:37]</p>
<p>like, the first time</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:39]</p>
<p>since you've been an adult</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:41]</p>
<p>where you would have a mortgage payment,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:09:44]</p>
<p>where you don't have one.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:46]</p>
<p>Yeah. I mean, I guess I shouldn't totally say that because after you buy a house, right, you get the skip month, and so I've had a couple of those. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:54]</p>
<p>But,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:09:55]</p>
<p>you know, the skip month is a little misleading because you you actually pay for that at closing. So Right.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:00]</p>
<p>So you just paid off your house. What are you gonna do next?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:05]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:06]</p>
<p>I really don't know. I mean, I that's a that's a darn good question. Probably save more. I don't know. It</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:13]</p>
<p>we you know, so this is funny. A lot of folks have asked me this. So let me let me rewind.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:18]</p>
<p>The number one question we've gotten is, how did you do this? Couple of people have asked, are you on the Dave Ramsey kick?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:25]</p>
<p>And the answer to that is no. I'm not on the Dave Ramsey kick. How we did this is we we just, like, went at it like a spider monkey.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:34]</p>
<p>The the whole diagram</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:36]</p>
<p>thing that's in the picture and the one that I blogged about</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:40]</p>
<p>was intended to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:10:42]</p>
<p>visualize our progress, and so it was motivation.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:46]</p>
<p>And you kinda have this hardwired into you. You set these financial goals, and you make them happen. Like, once you said, I wonder if I can save a year's worth of expenses, and then you did it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:10:59]</p>
<p>You just kinda set these and then achieve them. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:04]</p>
<p>Yeah. Well, I mean, I like, I'm a big believer in goals. We've talked about that before, and I think</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:09]</p>
<p>financial</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:10]</p>
<p>goals are important.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:12]</p>
<p>Right? So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:13]</p>
<p>having that honeypot, if you will, that emergency fund,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:17]</p>
<p>having a certain amount going into your four zero one k,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:19]</p>
<p>going after the mortgage,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:21]</p>
<p>trying to pay down your debts.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:23]</p>
<p>Like,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:24]</p>
<p>for me, these are easy tangible goals. Right? And they're the one nice thing about financial goals is they're really simple to track. Right? You don't it's not like a lot of self help or self improvement stuff becomes very gray. And when it comes to, like, how am I doing on the mortgage, right, easy to track. I that's I got a number for that. Right. And you can watch it go down.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:11:48]</p>
<p>Exactly. And there's something really satisfying about that. I I will say, when I when I made the call so this is funny. I tried paying the final payment online, and it wouldn't let me. It told me that I could not do</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:00]</p>
<p>a payment within 95%</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:02]</p>
<p>of my remaining balance online, which I I don't know why it doesn't make any sense, whatever.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:08]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:09]</p>
<p>and I called up to figure out what was going on. Like, oh, yeah. We can't do that, but we could do it over the phone. Was like, oh, okay. Great. Let's go ahead and do that. Get to that process. Like, oh, there'll be a $15 servicing fee. And I'm like, wait. What? I can't do it online, but you're gonna charge me a $15 servicing fee? So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:23]</p>
<p>consequently, I was like, you know what? You can have the 15 because you're not getting any more of my money and took care of it, and then I went to work. Nice.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:32]</p>
<p>Yeah. So the correct answer to my initial question is you just paid off your mortgage. What are you gonna do next? Was I'm going to Disney World.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:42]</p>
<p>Yeah. Right? You</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:44]</p>
<p>know what? A trip to Disney World or just a family vacation, I think, is is a nice way to spend some of my surplus cash.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:53]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:12:54]</p>
<p>eventually</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:12:56]</p>
<p>I believe that you should take your family on a Disney cruise because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:00]</p>
<p>they're awesome, and you like water, and you like to eat well.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:05]</p>
<p>All these things are true. So I will I will look into that, John, and we'll we'll see. I've I don't know. I've never been on a cruise. Do I need a passport for a cruise?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:12]</p>
<p>Probably.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:13]</p>
<p>Okay. Well, I that's that's more work then.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:17]</p>
<p>True.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:18]</p>
<p>But missus Lemon, I'm sure, could figure out where you can get to get passport.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:22]</p>
<p>Yeah. It's probably true.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:26]</p>
<p>So big week here.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:28]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:30]</p>
<p>like, seriously, the impact on the budget hasn't really clicked in because that's next month. So you'll have to ask me, like, what it's like not having a mortgage payment.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:37]</p>
<p>And I I think it's gonna be like, oh, I just found a thousand dollars,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:41]</p>
<p>you know, if you can imagine that. Right.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:44]</p>
<p>Which</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:45]</p>
<p>I don't like, I think about what I throw up my retirement accounts,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:49]</p>
<p>and I wonder what would I be doing with that if I wasn't throwing them at retirement accounts?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:13:55]</p>
<p>And I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:13:59]</p>
<p>It's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:00]</p>
<p>yeah. I'll</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:01]</p>
<p>let you know. I mean, I I really so the only thing I can think of is there was a period of time when we were looking for a house when we moved to Seymour</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:09]</p>
<p>where I didn't have a mortgage payment, and so that amassed</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:12]</p>
<p>in my checking account.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:14]</p>
<p>And and then I just put it on a down payment for a house. Right. So that's the closest I got, but I it's just yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:21]</p>
<p>I think the answer, John, is probably to say that because I I'm not it's not of my nature to just go spend it. Spend. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:28]</p>
<p>Joel Fritchie,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:29]</p>
<p>as who our listeners will know from our Fritchie sticker campaign,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:34]</p>
<p>wants us to move to the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:38]</p>
<p>I've thrown out the idea of a lemon winter home in the Dominican Republic,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:42]</p>
<p>which could double as the life with a twist of lemon bunker.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:45]</p>
<p>That just sounds expensive.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:48]</p>
<p>I don't know. What what does land cost on an island?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:52]</p>
<p>I I have no idea. What does, hurricane insurance cost on an island?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:14:57]</p>
<p>Truth.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:14:58]</p>
<p>Yeah. See? So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:00]</p>
<p>I will tell you this. I did not pay off my mortgage by just picking up little fun side homes.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:07]</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:08]</p>
<p>Fair enough. I guarantee you when Mark Buetel gets here, your your father-in-law,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:14]</p>
<p>will</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:15]</p>
<p>he'll I'm I'm I'm gonna eat with him. Right? And I'd be like, so</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:19]</p>
<p>we go in Dutch? He'd be like, no. You're gonna cut off your mortgage.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:24]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:26]</p>
<p>I'm his retirement plan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:28]</p>
<p>There you go. Hey. You know what, John? That's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:31]</p>
<p>he's doing pretty good He he could have worse plans. You're right.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:37]</p>
<p>Good deal. Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:15:39]</p>
<p>It's kind of an interesting weekend in the world of Apple.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:43]</p>
<p>Yeah, man. There's like, I saw some other, like, side stories in the news too besides the Johnny Ive departure.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:15:51]</p>
<p>They were talking about, like, car tech and things like that. Did you see hear on all of those mailing lists? So I don't know what spurred any of this. But There there was an acquisition that happened, I believe, was the the driver behind the car tech. I don't get really excited about the car tech stuff anymore because</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:07]</p>
<p>for a while, Apple was supposedly doing its own,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:11]</p>
<p>you know, autonomous vehicle and they pulled out or what, like, to me Right. There's nothing substantive.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:17]</p>
<p>Not to mention that</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:19]</p>
<p>I I hate buying a car. I'd rather buy a new house. What does that tell you? Than buying a car. So I can't imagine that whatever they're cooking up, I'm gonna get</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:28]</p>
<p>Right. Ever. Like, I just yeah. That's not I hate buying a car, John. I really hate buying a car. I'm with you, ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:36]</p>
<p>So, yeah, Johnny Ive or Johnny Ive, I guess, what I should say that.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:41]</p>
<p>Right? He's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:42]</p>
<p>he's the chief of or he was the chief of design</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:46]</p>
<p>at Apple. I think he probably had a different, like, more fancy title. But for he started off designing the exteriors</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:54]</p>
<p>of all of the hardware</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:16:57]</p>
<p>at Apple. And he apparently was, like, really super close friends</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:00]</p>
<p>with Steve Jobs. Eventually, he got moved over to take over also, like, the aesthetics</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:06]</p>
<p>of the interface as well. And so he handled,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:10]</p>
<p>you know, everything you touch, everything you see, basically.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:14]</p>
<p>And,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:15]</p>
<p>I mean, there's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:17]</p>
<p>there are some interesting</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:19]</p>
<p>things attached to his reign. Right? All of the aluminium</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:23]</p>
<p>max that we love today</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:26]</p>
<p>are I mean you know, Joni Ive based. Even going back before that, he was instrumental</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:32]</p>
<p>in the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:33]</p>
<p>colorful</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:34]</p>
<p>iMac line.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:17:36]</p>
<p>Do you remember the colorful iMac line? Yes. I do. Okay. I wasn't sure you were born for that time.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:43]</p>
<p>I was probably still in elementary school, but, yes, I I remember that very clearly because we had</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:50]</p>
<p>a performer,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:52]</p>
<p>and then</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:54]</p>
<p>my dad went windows.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:17:56]</p>
<p>So I never actually owned one, And I was always so jealous because, you know, they look super cool.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:01]</p>
<p>I hope your dad still has that performer because there's somewhere there's a museum just Jones in to to get it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:08]</p>
<p>So, yeah, that that was kind of the resurgence of Apple. Right? Like, it started there. That was a Jobs comes back, and that's his kinda</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:17]</p>
<p>kickoff</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:18:18]</p>
<p>piece of hardware to turn Apple around so that Apple still exists.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:22]</p>
<p>Yep. And you take a look at what Apple device you might have in your life. Right? So for me, I'm working on a MacBook. I'm wearing an Apple Watch. I've got an iPhone sitting in front of me, and I have an iPad in the bag to my right. All of those things</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:36]</p>
<p>were designed</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:37]</p>
<p>under Joni Ive. Right? They're influenced by his,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:41]</p>
<p>like what what does he call it? He talks about, like, getting to the essence of the device.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:45]</p>
<p>Right? So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:47]</p>
<p>he's there's a there's, like, the simplicity that Apple is known for. That's that's a Joni Ive thing. Like, that that really, I think, reflects</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:18:55]</p>
<p>his design perspective. And I don't know if you remember, but you used to open up, like, the calendar app, and it looked like a desk calendar, or you opened up the contacts app, and it looked like a Rolodex.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:05]</p>
<p>Yep. So that was all pre Joni Ive UI.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:10]</p>
<p>And and all of this nice, clean,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:13]</p>
<p>flat</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:14]</p>
<p>I I don't even know what to call it. Just like</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:18]</p>
<p>flatness</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:19]</p>
<p>of the interface</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:20]</p>
<p>is is also Joni Ive. Right? And so his influence just</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:25]</p>
<p>whether or not we wanna admit it. Right? It is</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:29]</p>
<p>everywhere if you're using electronic device because a lot of these characteristics</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:33]</p>
<p>of operating systems and whatnot today,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:36]</p>
<p>they they come from Joni.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:39]</p>
<p>Yeah. So Steve Jobs,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:42]</p>
<p>I can't remember what product launch it was, but he talks about Apple sitting at this intersection</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:48]</p>
<p>of technology and the liberal arts.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:51]</p>
<p>And I think Johnny Ive really</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:19:54]</p>
<p>is the focal point for that,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:19:58]</p>
<p>by making technology beautiful inside and out, really. If not the focal point, at least the face of. Right? Right. And I think that's</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:06]</p>
<p>I think that's what's important about this news is we don't know what'll happen next.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:11]</p>
<p>Now, he's technically not</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:13]</p>
<p>a 100% leaving. He's starting his own design company.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:17]</p>
<p>I think Loveform or something like that. They have something like that. Yeah. Designers have weird naming. I mean, if he was responsible for Creatives, man. Naming in</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:25]</p>
<p>the Apple space, then this this explains a lot. But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:31]</p>
<p>he supposedly is going to still do some design work. Like, his company's first customer will be Apple. Right? Right. It's a pretty good deal to land out the gate, I think. Yep.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:20:40]</p>
<p>But I I don't know. I I expect to see a little bit of change. Right? Because you're you're getting new creative juices at the top.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:47]</p>
<p>Yep. And, I mean, really, he formed that team. So assuming they promote from within Apple,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:54]</p>
<p>then I think that his presence will linger on a little bit.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:20:58]</p>
<p>But who knows? I mean, all up in the air.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:01]</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, I mean, we've probably come to the end of everything he had planned.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:07]</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:09]</p>
<p>Who knows, John? Who knows?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:11]</p>
<p>I I believe so they have announced who's next, and I believe it is from his team. So K. But again, you know, creative types, even when they work together in an org chart or whatever, they've got their own little nuances, and so we're gonna see some changes that are specific to the new regime.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:30]</p>
<p>And I I actually find that really exciting. I'm really intrigued to see</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:34]</p>
<p>what happens, how things evolve.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:37]</p>
<p>You know, I think Joni's gonna go out on top with this Mac Pro</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:41]</p>
<p>probably being the last I mean, I'm sure he's designed stuff</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:21:45]</p>
<p>that hasn't been released, but this is the last thing he designed and was released while he was there, at least as far as we know. Right. And I that's a big deal to me, at least.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:56]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:21:57]</p>
<p>So we'll see. I mean, most of our listeners probably have never heard of him before. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:04]</p>
<p>They probably though heard a sound bite of him. Everybody knows</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:08]</p>
<p>the British voice, the aluminium guy. Aluminium.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:15]</p>
<p>So let's milkshake some Max.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:17]</p>
<p>We didn't talk about Marvel at all. Do you have Spider Man tickets?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:20]</p>
<p>I I do not have tickets, but I am going on Friday. So here's the skinny. The theater I'm going to, it's a matinee showing. This is actually wild. They've got 12 screens on Friday, July 5. Yeah. All of them are showing Spider Man. Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:35]</p>
<p>That comes out today, doesn't it? Tuesday when we're recording?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:38]</p>
<p>I believe that is correct. Yes. And I thought about getting tickets downtown,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:42]</p>
<p>but I'm I'm just too old and too tired.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:45]</p>
<p>Right. I'm still recovering from Avengers Endgame, which by the way, comes out at the end of the month. Nice. Just digitally, or can I buy a disc?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:52]</p>
<p>I I since I don't buy discs, I don't know, John.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:22:56]</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:22:57]</p>
<p>But I did see I did see it ready for preorder on iTunes. I saw the release date, so I'm looking forward to to</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:04]</p>
<p>getting it. I actually have not seen it since we saw it in theaters together. I don't know. Did you go again after we saw it? Yeah. I took my wife to go see it. Okay. So I saw it after they added the Spider Man far from Holden trailer to the end. Apparently, it's rereleased with, like, six extra minutes again.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:24]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:25]</p>
<p>There's an extra scene or something. Like, I missus Lemon said she saw some article, I haven't had a chance to look this up. So I I need to do that if we, you know, continue our theme of not doing homework for a podcast. Here we are.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:38]</p>
<p>But Yeah. I yeah. I'm I'm looking forward to it because I haven't seen it since it came out.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:43]</p>
<p>Yeah. So that should be good.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:46]</p>
<p>I hope it is.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:49]</p>
<p>I mean, it can't be bad.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:52]</p>
<p>Yeah. You haven't seen it, so you haven't decided where it ranks yet, really, have you?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:23:57]</p>
<p>Too early to say?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:23:59]</p>
<p>With with for Endgame specifically?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:01]</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:03]</p>
<p>Well, so I think I said this when we went and saw it. I am looking forward to watching</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:08]</p>
<p>Infinity Wars and Endgame back to back as a single arc,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:12]</p>
<p>and I wanna see how I feel after that. I feel like I'm probably two to three showings away</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:18]</p>
<p>from knowing where it falls in line.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:20]</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:21]</p>
<p>Now I'm I'm not I'm</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:24]</p>
<p>not sure what to make of far from home</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:27]</p>
<p>or homecoming.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:29]</p>
<p>Far from homecoming.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:30]</p>
<p>So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:31]</p>
<p>homecoming came out</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:33]</p>
<p>a couple years ago. Yeah. Far From Home comes out today.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:37]</p>
<p>Somebody was not thinking ahead by using the word home twice in the same series.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:24:44]</p>
<p>This is what happens when</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:46]</p>
<p>Marvel isn't completely in charge. Right. That's that's definitely a Sony move. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:24:50]</p>
<p>I I'm like, I like the new Spider Man. I enjoyed Homecoming. I've enjoyed him in both Civil War and Infinity Wars, and and even Endgame, though. That was a pretty short</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:02]</p>
<p>appearance that he had there. But it was an awesome</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:06]</p>
<p>introduction scene or homecoming scene, if you will. Yep. It was. So I think the thing is, supposedly, with this movie, right, like, Sony</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:14]</p>
<p>and Marvel had a few disagreements. We know that based upon</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:17]</p>
<p>the announcement, the trailer,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:19]</p>
<p>all that jazz. So I'm curious to see where else their disagreements,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:22]</p>
<p>you know, popped up. And I think I think that really could make or break this franchise.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:27]</p>
<p>I'm hoping that the movie gives us some hint as to what comes out next because I don't know that we've got another Marvel release</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:36]</p>
<p>this year,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:37]</p>
<p>which which means this is the only teaser into</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:40]</p>
<p>the the future of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:25:45]</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:25:46]</p>
<p>And based on the initial trailer, which is all I've read or seen about it,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:25:51]</p>
<p>it's kinda like a wrap up or takes place in the aftermath of Endgame.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:25:57]</p>
<p>Right. Yeah. So if you recall, there was that special</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:00]</p>
<p>trailer release</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:01]</p>
<p>because there there was this actually, the second trailer with the little</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:05]</p>
<p>doohickey in front that's like, hey, spoiler alert Yep. Kinda deal.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:10]</p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:11]</p>
<p>who knows? I hope they don't spend too much time on that. Like, they gotta move on and get it to their own story.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:16]</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:17]</p>
<p>I I'm not I I still have mixed feelings about</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:20]</p>
<p>the</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:21]</p>
<p>Tony Stark emotional play</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:23]</p>
<p>as to whether or not that's a good call. I again, we'll see. We'll see. And the next time we record, I should have some feedback for you. Hopefully, you'll see it. Are you gonna go see it? Or what's what's Yeah. I think I'm I'm planning to see it with my dad this weekend, but I should probably lock in tickets. There</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:39]</p>
<p>you go. Yeah. I couldn't believe that there were no reserved seating at this matinee when they got 12 theaters going.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:46]</p>
<p>Weird. It's weird world.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:26:49]</p>
<p>Alright,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:26:50]</p>
<p>Stanley. That's the end of our list for this week. Anything else you wanna say? Well, we should probably talk about meat rubs. Right? Because we were gonna do all the m's.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:26:59]</p>
<p>Even though it's our not really anniversary episode.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:03]</p>
<p>Right. Well, we'll</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:05]</p>
<p>you killjoy you. I'm just curious. Have you been grilling at all? Because it has been warm here.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:27:10]</p>
<p>I grilled today,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:27:12]</p>
<p>just burgers,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:27:13]</p>
<p>and I did not use a meat rub. I just used salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:19]</p>
<p>So when you got the hamburger,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:22]</p>
<p>was it already formed, or did you form it? I formed it. Did you include anything into the meat?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:27:28]</p>
<p>Salt, pepper, and garlic powder.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:30]</p>
<p>Okay. So you don't use any kind of filler?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:33]</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:34]</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:27:35]</p>
<p>What what was the percentage? Loaf, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:40]</p>
<p>Oh, that sounds good.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:42]</p>
<p>What was the percentage on the meat, John? Was it, like, eighty five fifteen, or what were we up to? I think it was eighty twenty, if I remember correctly. Okay. Nice, good, fatty cut there. Nothing wrong with that. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:27:54]</p>
<p>did you what do what do you cook your burgers to? Medium?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:27:58]</p>
<p>Medium rare? That</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:00]</p>
<p>requires paying attention, Stan. I throw them on the grill at really high heat and do it three minutes each side.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:08]</p>
<p>So probably</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:10]</p>
<p>medium ish.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:11]</p>
<p>Okay. So you had some pink in the middle? Yeah. But not fleshy?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:16]</p>
<p>Correct. Alright. And and cheese?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:20]</p>
<p>Just cheddar cheese on top. I did not melt the cheese on the burger today.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:24]</p>
<p>Why not, John?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:28]</p>
<p>Requires forethought, and it was really hot outside.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:30]</p>
<p>Okay. And then what about your bun?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:34]</p>
<p>So Anna picked up buns from</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:37]</p>
<p>the grocery store and they were like this Asiago</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:41]</p>
<p>cheese hamburger bun that was delicious.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:45]</p>
<p>Fascinating. That sounds like they could be good. I thought of you I I I do know though</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:50]</p>
<p>well, I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:28:51]</p>
<p>would wonder how the Asiago flavor would compete with the cheddar.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:28:55]</p>
<p>Yeah. It was a little off. Okay. I mean, just cheese. So That is true. That is true. So</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:02]</p>
<p>I did think of you. I was in Aldi on Sunday, and I saw brioche burger buns. I thought that that looks like that could be good. And it was in Aldi, so I always think of John Kollmeyer.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:12]</p>
<p>Hey. I love Aldi because I'm cheap, and I wanna be like you when I grow up with a paid off house. There you go. Oh, I'll tell you what, man.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:20]</p>
<p>Shopping at Aldi definitely helps.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:23]</p>
<p>But so I I did another pork butt recently, and I got rave reviews. But I actually haven't started the grill here</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:30]</p>
<p>probably</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:31]</p>
<p>in a couple meat smoker?</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:33]</p>
<p>No. No. No. I've I've I've used it since then, but it it just it's been a minute or two here. I am gonna use it on Thursday for July 4. I will do some rocks. Because I will be out of town.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:44]</p>
<p>Oh, sad. Oh, that's right. You're going to Taliesin. Right? Yep.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:48]</p>
<p>That'll be interesting. And America Players Theater.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:52]</p>
<p>Alright. Well, on the next episode, we'll have a review of Taliesin.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:29:55]</p>
<p>You'll have to explain to people what Taliesin is.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:58]</p>
<p>K.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:29:59]</p>
<p>Silver brow.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:01]</p>
<p>There you go. Episode 53, learn about Taliesin.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:05]</p>
<p>Get some pictures with you and the missus. I</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:07]</p>
<p>will do my best.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:09]</p>
<p>It's best if I put her in charge of that. Are you bringing the, the camera? I think I am. Now that I've dusted it off, took some ad hoc wedding photos for one of Anna's friends,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:20]</p>
<p>so</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:21]</p>
<p>I'm ready to go. I even have Lightroom installed</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:24]</p>
<p>again.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:25]</p>
<p>Nice. I think Taliesin is the kind of place that I would wanna bring my camera.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:29]</p>
<p>I'll just leave it at that. But</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:31]</p>
<p>alright, John. So not, I'm not too excited because it's not our one year anniversary. It's just fifty two episodes, whatever that means. But,</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:40]</p>
<p>if if there were an anniversary, would say congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:44]</p>
<p>Don't make it weird, Stan.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_0</strong> [00:30:47]</p>
<p>Alright, John. Until next week, episode 53, still not one year of Life or the Twist of Lemon.</p>
<p><strong>SPEAKER_1</strong> [00:30:52]</p>
<p>Later.</p>
