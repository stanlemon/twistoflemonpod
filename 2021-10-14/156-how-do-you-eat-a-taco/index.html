    <p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>In this episode, we talk about a bunch of stuff we didn't have on the list of things to talk about. To kick it off, Stan wants to know how you eat a taco.</p>
<p>From there we talk about the season finale of Ted Lasso Season 2 and what we expect from future seasons from our offices that are both in disarray.</p>
<p>Finally, Jon calls out Stan for having Air Pods Max over his ears and not saying anything about them.</p>
<p>Listen in, if you like what you hear leave a review and let a friend know about Life with a Twist of Lemon</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
