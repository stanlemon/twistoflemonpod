Dear Listener,

This week Stan kicks off the episode by asking Jon if he's started listening to Christmas music yet.

If you've been paying attention to our Facebook or Twitter account you'll know that Jon was in Nashville. He talks about his experience with WordCamp US and some of the fun that he had in Nashville.

Big take away from Nashville Hot Chicken and the current #1 milkshake on Jon's list from Elliston Place Soda Shop.

Enjoy some photos, below!

This is probably where we should have stopped for time sake, but you'll get a longer edition of LWaToL this time around.

Stan and Jon talk about Grills so Jon can decide what kind of Grill he wants to get.

Finally, we're over halfway to our goal for support to Pastor Fritsche. Thanks for those who have supported so far. Let's reach $1000 before the end of the year.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
