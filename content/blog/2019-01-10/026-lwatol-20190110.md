**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:00]

Dramas, please.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:13]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:20]

This is life

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:22]

with a twist of lemon.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:24]

So I got a milkshake this week. Oh, yeah?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:27]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:29]

It actually raised a what I think is a relatively important philosophical question about the composition of milkshakes.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:36]

Okay.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:38]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:39]

I don't remember I don't remember how this came up, but Red Robin was,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:45]

mentioned to me as a good place for a milkshake. Oh, no. Whose heart are you gonna break today, Stan?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:53]

I think it was I think it was actually missus Lemon, but it it was corroborated somehow. I don't remember who brought it up. And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:59]

so this is the thing, though. Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:02]

And I I've never had a milkshake from Red Robin ever.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:06]

I I remember when missus Lemon last had a milkshake from Red Robin. It was, like, oh,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:12]

seven, eight years ago when we were in Pittsburgh, and Red Robin was very convenient.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:17]

Because she used to she used to always get one. I'd get a beer, and she would get a milkshake. Interesting. I always go with the freckled lemonade.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:24]

The what? Freckled lemonade. It's like the strawberry lemonade. It has real strawberries in it. It's delicious.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:30]

And bottomless. Do they actually call it the freckled lemonade? I believe so. It comes in this cool, like, twisty glass. It's awesome, man. Best thing about Red Robin.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:41]

So do you I'm gonna totally dig this here. Do you like the hamburgers at Red Robin? So I did

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:48]

originally, like, when Red Robin first came to the Milwaukee area.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:52]

Now

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:53]

not particularly.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:55]

Do do you think that's because your palate has changed or because Red Robin has changed? I think probably mostly the former,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:05]

but I think that the Red Robin quality has also changed.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:09]

Okay.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:10]

Yeah. It's I mean, there's there's a certain part of it that's kind of like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:13]

I don't know, glorified McDonald's these days. Yeah. Remember

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:17]

Red Robin was like, it was the thing to do because of the bottomless french fries? Bottomless french fries, bottomless drinks.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:25]

Well, I mean, the bottom bottom everybody's got bottomless drinks. Those are called free refills.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:29]

Sure.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:31]

Not everybody has bottomless fries, but alright. I'm way off track here. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:36]

we we went to Red Robin,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:38]

not for dinner because we actually had a really good meal at,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:42]

Patachu

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:43]

Cafe Patachu's or I don't know. It's not Cafe Patachu. It's just the Patachu Foundation's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:48]

Public Greens

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:49]

restaurant at the Keystone Mall,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:51]

which if you're

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:53]

ever in Indianapolis,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:54]

you should Google Patachu,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:56]

check out all the different franchises

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:58]

they've got, like the different, I shouldn't say franchises, concepts, restaurant concepts.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:02]

Public Greens is one of those. The proceeds go to,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:06]

meals for

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:08]

underprivileged

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:09]

kids,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:10]

basically.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:11]

So it's kinda cool. Got a great meal there. Missus Lemo was like, hey. Let's get a milkshake.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:17]

Headed to Red Robin because it was only relatively out of the way rather than grossly out of the way.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:23]

And I said, okay. Go and, you know, do what you gotta do. And I got the play by play from her via text while she was ordering at the bar,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:32]

and we we only ordered two milkshakes.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:35]

Right. They were outrageously priced, by the way. They were, like, $5 a pop.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:39]

But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:41]

the intent was us to split one, and then she had the other one poured into three

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:45]

small cups for the children because, you know, I I can't get away with Right. Getting luxuries for my kids. You can, but you're just you're just too good of a dad.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:55]

You don't wanna keep things from your children.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:58]

It

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:59]

was a long drive home. Let's just we'll leave it there.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:03]

But so so here's the thing, This is where the philosophical question comes in. I was asking missus Lemon to tell me each step and every ingredient that was used. And, I'm just doing a chocolate milkshake. Right? Like, this is the baseline. I'm not doing any of the fancy milkshakes that they got on the menu or any of that. And they do vanilla soft serve Oh, no. And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:25]

chocolate

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:26]

Hershey syrup,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:28]

and that's it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:29]

Oh, no. And so here's here's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:32]

here's my philosophical question for you.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:35]

If you use

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:37]

soft serve ice cream,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:39]

does that mean you don't have to use milk? Because missus Lemon and I argued about this for almost ten minutes on the drive home.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:51]

That's a good question.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:53]

I'm more stuck on the point, is it morally right to charge $5 for soft serve ice cream and Hershey syrup?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:02]

Yeah. Well,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:04]

that's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:07]

I at some point, we're gonna incorporate, so I can expense stupid mistakes like Fred Robin milkshakes.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:13]

But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:14]

here's the thing, though. It is a milkshake.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:18]

It is not a soft serve shake. It is not an ice cream shake. It is a milkshake.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:24]

And yes,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:25]

I know that there's milk in the soft serve, in the ice cream.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:30]

But to me,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:32]

when you say milkshake,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:33]

that is prescriptive of the primary ingredient.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:37]

This this just opens up a whole host of problems, Stan.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:41]

Because you don't shake a milkshake either.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:45]

You kind of stir and blend it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:48]

Do you

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:50]

okay. That that's a

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:52]

that's valid. But do you do you think that that could be a a historical artifact from, like, a drink shaker? It could be. Maybe? Like, old time

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:00]

soda shop.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:02]

I don't know. We're we're gonna have to dig into the history.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:06]

I I will research this, but I I still the shake part aside I'm with you. Comes first. I think there probably has to be at least an ounce of milk in order to call it a milkshake.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:16]

Alright. At least an ounce. So one shot of milk required.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:20]

So here's here's this evolved into,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:24]

like, we were discussing the philosophy,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:26]

the ingredients,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:27]

you know, the general composition,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:29]

but there was a more practical problem, which was that the slurpability of this thing was terrible. I mean, I like, I couldn't

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:37]

I couldn't get it up the straw, man. Like, the soft serve didn't melt in by the time it got out of car? Eventually.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:44]

But here's the thing. I would have expected the other problem. That's all I'm saying.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:49]

Well, there was no milk, though. That's the thing. Like, it it hadn't been thinned enough. It was basically mixed it. Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:57]

Supposedly.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:59]

I Sarah did tell me that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:02]

when he when the the bartender was scooping it out into the small cups,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:07]

he used a spoon.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:09]

K. And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:10]

and I was like, a

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:13]

properly done milkshake, you should be able to pour

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:16]

Yes. From the vessel into the cups. Right? So if you have to scoop it, something's wrong. Yep. And it could be the lack of milk. It could be the lack of mixing,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:26]

and it could also just be some other thing I don't know and really don't wanna contemplate because it's probably gross.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:32]

But the, like, I just don't get it, man. How do you make a milkshake without pouring some milk into the thing? I'm with you.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:40]

So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:41]

moral of the story,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:43]

Red Robin milkshake's

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:44]

bad.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:46]

Well, I mean, I think so. Like, I soft serve really isn't a great starting point. Okay? So maybe maybe

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:52]

it was a bad milkshake maker. Like, maybe this was just not his craft or his night.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:58]

And,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:59]

you know, I should give it another shot. But the the fact of the matter is

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:03]

soft serve is just not a good place to start a milkshake. You know? Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:08]

I'm with you. So I think to me, it was like

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:12]

it was like a Wendy's Frosty.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:14]

And and the straws were narrow, which also, you know, even if, like, slurpability was better,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:20]

the narrow straws weren't gonna help the situation. That was actually the first thing my kids commented on. They're like, what are these straws? These aren't these aren't milkshake straws. And you know what they said to me? This is Henry. Henry waited, he goes, could we stop by Wileepalooza on the way home to get better straws?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:37]

And you're like, that's good thinking, son. But if we're gonna stop at Wileepalooza,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:42]

we're gonna get a good milkshake too.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:44]

Yeah. And and by that point, it was kinda late, and I I don't know. I I appreciated where his mind was at. I I like that my children know when there's a problem, you should try to fix it, and they thought outside of the box in order to fix it. Now it was arguably an expensive

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:04]

fix, but, you know, it it was a fix nonetheless. I I I gave him gave him props for that.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:08]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:09]

I'm with you.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:11]

Keeping on topic of milkshakes, I'm sending you an Amazon link right now. I need you to order these for me and yourself

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:17]

so that we can try these out and review.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:21]

Wait. What?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:24]

How did you even find this? Pot Tarts strawberry milkshake? Walking

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:28]

through Walmart,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:30]

and I almost bought them right then, but I didn't pull the trigger. I was still kind of in a sugar coma from the holidays.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:38]

So there are strawberry

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:41]

milkshake Pop Tarts. There are also blueberry milkshake Pop Tarts.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:47]

Blueberry milkshake? I that I feel like I could pontificate just on whether or not blueberry is an appropriate milkshake. I'm with you. Flavor, but

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:56]

I did not see any chocolate on this? No. I have not.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:00]

They they are not looking good, my Two and a half stars. Oh, man. We'll have to pair this with the, gas station milkshake.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:09]

It sounds like

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:11]

most of these are complaints about the Pop Tarts being broken in the box.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:16]

I don't, like what kind of idiot

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:19]

orders Pop Tarts on Amazon?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:21]

Yeah. And expects them to come in one piece. For what?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:25]

$14

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:25]

for a box of 16?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:27]

Sounds a little pricey.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:29]

Wow. These are two calories per Pop Tart. Oh, man.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:35]

Wow.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:39]

Well, I alright. Color me intrigued. I can't

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:42]

who thought this was a good idea? Delicious strawberry milkshake flavor in every bite. Satisfy your sweet tooth with the irresistible

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:50]

taste of strawberry milkshake.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:52]

Toaster pastries filled with delicious creamy strawberry flavored goodness and topped with frosting and sprinkles.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:59]

And who puts sprinkles on a milkshake?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:02]

I don't know. There's there's so many things wrong, but it's got zero grams of trans fat. So But there's that. Insane. That's all that's almost healthy.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:10]

I love this. It says, it is both naturally

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:12]

and artificially flavored.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:18]

One day, Stan. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:21]

Wow. This is really amazing. I see the blueberry. Oh, there's vanilla milkshakes.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:25]

Vanilla milkshake.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:27]

But if but do they have chocolate? That's I didn't see chocolate. I saw some hot chocolate pop tarts.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:35]

Yeah. Wow. Pop tarts have really branched out. I know. They used to be what? Strawberry,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:40]

brown sugar,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:43]

cherry, maybe? Yeah. This pumpkin pie Pop Tarts?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:47]

Does not sound good at all. Gone nutty peanut butter flavor toaster toaster pastries.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:53]

When was the last time you had a Pop Star Pop Tart stand?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:57]

An actual Pop Tart brand Pop Tart or

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:00]

something that looks and felt like a Pop Tart in my mind? As long as it wasn't made by a high quality bakery and it was, like, made in bulk, I would count it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:10]

Okay.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:11]

Alright. So that's that's been a while. I would say

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:16]

five years, maybe.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:19]

Okay. Because I I I remember exactly when

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:22]

I had it. It was a moment of weakness at my in laws. My mother-in-law had bought it had bought a box of pop tarts for,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:30]

I believe, my niece.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:32]

And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:33]

I was like, there's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:35]

eight of those in the pack, and there's only one of you.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:38]

I will try one. So, you know, it's it's a it's a bad decision.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:42]

But interestingly, I did have a,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:45]

like, a homemade

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:47]

Pop Tart at a really fantastic restaurant in Saint Joe's, Michigan, the name of which is eluding me right now.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:55]

But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:56]

we went there when we were camping this summer, and they had they had Pop Tarts. Like, it was a whole thing,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:02]

and they were absolutely

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:04]

delicious.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:05]

I bet. That's why those don't count.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:09]

Well, I mean, it's okay. Hold up. Are you asserting that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:12]

a normal Pop Tart is not delicious?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:15]

I'm saying that five year old me

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:18]

would not

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:19]

have liked a Fresh Bakery one when I had the real deal

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:24]

just waiting on the shelf at the grocery store.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:28]

Why why do you think that is? You think that was just advertising, or you think it was something else? My guess is gonna be the copious amounts of sugar.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:35]

Okay. But a a, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:39]

home baked I I I would bet that a home baked

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:43]

Pop Tart is going to have more sugar in it. You think so?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:47]

Oh, no doubt, man. I mean, I listen. Do not underestimate what preservatives can do in place of sugar. Uh-huh. Like, yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:56]

I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:57]

believe me, I'm sure let's see. I wonder if we can get the nutritional information off of this package,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:01]

the Pop Tarts.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:03]

So I was I was trying to remember what the name of the place is. It's the Mason Jar Cafe in Saint Joseph, Michigan.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:09]

It's it is absolutely legit. Great breakfast, but the the Pop Tarts were out of this world too.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:14]

Alright. Let's see.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:15]

Sugar,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:16]

15 grams. That's nothing. That is nothing.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:23]

I use more than that in a, loaf of bread, John. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:30]

Alright.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:31]

Enough of milkshakes and Pop Tarts and all other sugary things.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:36]

We need to Did you get my Get more sour? Animation

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:40]

that I do. Got your animation. I'm not entirely sure what you're trying to show me other than you have lack of self control when it comes to your phone.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:49]

What do you think I got lack of self control when it comes to my phone? So I sent you I sent you an animation of me trying to get screen time

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:57]

working

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:58]

for

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:00]

Lucy, but really just on a kid device.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:03]

And I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:05]

dude, I don't know what it is,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:07]

but none of the big companies can seem to pull off a kid mode well.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:12]

Yeah. You know, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:14]

all I wanted to do was put some restrictions down. Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:18]

Lock down the amount of time,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:20]

and it pains me. It pains me to say this, but Apple's whole screen time, family sharing,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:27]

kid thing is total garbage.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:30]

Absolute garbage.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:32]

So the video I guess I I could post this on Facebook. The the video I was trying to share with you, I would, like, set what the downtime was, which is the total or, like, the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:42]

the the window of time where the the apps can't be used. Right? Right. And I would set it. I would go back and clear out.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:50]

Like, it would just disappear.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:52]

Sounds like a Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:54]

Well, then I'd go down to content and privacy restrictions. Pretty important section. Right? Flip the little toggle, and you could see it just jump right back. Flip it again. Just jump right back. So I have no idea what's going on,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:07]

but it it just will not persist. And so

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:11]

I don't know. I'm I'm frustrated because I was, like, at my wit's end with the Kindle Fire

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:18]

HD whatever

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:20]

stuff that they've got because their parent monitoring stuff is also garbage.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:16:28]

Time to write your own app, Sam.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:30]

No.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:31]

No, John. That's not the answer.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:33]

This see, this is the thing. Right? Like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:37]

parental controls, monitoring has to be integrated at the operating system level. It's it's gotta be done well. And if it's done really well,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:44]

like, I can handle I can manage it from my phone

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:48]

on the device that the kid has. Right? And I can also see the reports and kinda figure out what they're doing and all that stuff.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:55]

And and,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:56]

like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:57]

part where I'm able to

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:59]

actually limit the kid from doing something, that's the thing that doesn't work, and that's kind of a big deal. Right.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:05]

And I I don't know. I have no

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:08]

like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:09]

what who who am I gonna get help from? Am I gonna call the Apple's customer support and show them this video?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:17]

They'll tell you to reinstall

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:21]

OS on the device.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:23]

I I wiped the device, the original device, like, the the device that Lucy's using. I guess I could wipe every other device I use, but that doesn't seem like a good idea. No.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:34]

I it's just I don't know, man. Like, I don't know

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:37]

there's there's no recourse for me other than to just not use it this way. Can you do this at the network level, Stan?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:45]

Or is there stuff that doesn't have Internet connection that she's using on the phone or whatever it is?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:52]

Yeah. So it's an interesting question. I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:56]

I could prop like, in terms of the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:59]

shut this phone down at this hour, yeah, I could definitely do that. Right? Like, just kinda block the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:06]

the what is it? The MAC ID?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:09]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:10]

And just and just be done with it. But there there are other things on the phone I don't want her to do

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:17]

that I can't do that way. I I guess I probably could get clever with like, one one thing I wanted to disable was the mail app, right, and just not have that. Right. But I I could block the ports.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:29]

It just doesn't seem like it doesn't seem like the right answer to me, you know? It seems a little tedious.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:34]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:36]

And not to mention,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:38]

my

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:39]

my router is not gonna be easily manageable from my phone, which is also like, I wanna be able to control it from my phone. Right? That you could write an app for.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:48]

Oh, gosh, John.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:50]

Yes. I could I could write an app for that with all that spare time I've got.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:18:55]

Well,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:18:57]

this is much better than I thought it was gonna be. I thought that we were gonna have a moral debate about

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:03]

how much green time kids should have, and I have no horse in that race, and I know that people are very, very passionate about it. So I didn't wanna touch that with a 10 foot pole.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:13]

You don't wanna discuss whether or not kids should be spending time on screens?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:17]

Yeah. I think it's a matter of how much time they spend on screens.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:21]

Yeah. Maybe. I don't know. It's interesting. Like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:24]

we resisted screen time for a really long time,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:27]

and, I I would say we're

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:30]

we're still pretty

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:32]

old fashioned in turn. I I say that I've been spending my evening trying to get a phone configured for Lucy. But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:39]

truth be told, like, our kids don't actually spend a lot of time on devices,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:43]

mainly because the devices that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:45]

are available to them are slow and painful,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:48]

namely the Kindles,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:49]

which again, why I'm assumed with this iPhone.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:52]

Right. As

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:54]

I'm sitting here evaluating this, John, it seems like a

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:58]

series of poor decisions on my part tonight.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:00]

Anyhow,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:05]

Too too much of anything is bad. Right? Like, I think we could just leave it at that. I'd love to spend less time on screens.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:13]

Yeah. You didn't you have some absurdly low

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:16]

screen time report this this week? I think I averaged just over an hour mostly in the Kindle app.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:23]

That's per day?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:25]

Yeah. Average per day.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:28]

Well, it's not bad. I can't imagine not touching my phone. I think I'm still up in the three hour range. Mine does include the Kindle app and as of late, the Netflix app because I've not been Oh, see that I've not gotten into is watching video on my phone, which I'm sure keeps my usage down.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:45]

Well, do you do you share your screen time between devices?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:53]

Probably.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:55]

You should check that. So when I give you a screen time, three hours or whatever, that's across like, that's my iPhone and iPad combined.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:02]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:04]

So I like, I've been I've been trying to burn through

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:08]

a bunch of Netflix content so that I don't have to renew.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:12]

I don't know if I'm gonna be able to get through everything, but whatever.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:16]

And that's definitely taken a hit to my screen time. That's for sure. Right.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:22]

So but good news is I finished Luke Cage.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:25]

I'm done with Daredevil.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:27]

I also finished Gotham.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:29]

I decided not to finish House of Cards. Got, I think, three episodes in, and I was like, I can't do this. This is just Good to know. Way too slow.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:37]

So that leaves Iron Fist and Agents of Shield. That's all I got left. Oh, Agents of Shield is so good, Stan, And they haven't canceled that one yet.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:47]

Yeah. Don't get me to start about the canceled shows.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:51]

So Luke Cage season two was way better than season one in my opinion. What what did you think? Yeah. I thought it was better than season one. It still wasn't my favorite of the Netflix Marvel series.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:02]

Yeah. I mean, I don't think anything is going to be able to top this most recent season of Daredevil or at the Punisher.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:10]

I actually did like the defenders.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:12]

So, you know, that's if I were to rank them, I'd probably do Daredevil season three,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:17]

Punisher, Defenders,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:20]

maybe Daredevil season one next.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:24]

I have to think about that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:26]

But Luke Cage season two, I think would probably be next in line

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:32]

thereafter.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:33]

Yeah. I just I I enjoyed I enjoyed the story, the darkness.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:38]

There there was there weren't two arcs. There was only one arc. Did you notice that? Yes. I did.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:44]

I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:45]

I wish they had, like, come to these revelations

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:47]

sooner in their mass making of Marvel

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:51]

series.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:53]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:54]

See, I

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:56]

didn't mind

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:58]

the season of Luke Cage.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:00]

He just

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:01]

has a character. He's not that interesting to me. But then on the other hand, I like Jessica Jones,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:08]

whereas you can't stand the Jessica Jones series.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:12]

Yeah. I so I like the character.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:14]

I just I did not like. I don't know if it's a casting thing or if I just didn't like the particular stories

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:21]

that they chose

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:22]

to,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:25]

you know, kinda work into the show.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:28]

I think it was more the latter.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:30]

I think I told you too. I felt like it was really

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:33]

gory. Of course, I just I just made it through Gotham

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:36]

and good grief, Gotham was gory too. Yeah. I haven't started Gotham yet.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:42]

I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:43]

Gotham is one of these ones that I'm afraid it's gonna be, like, lost Mhmm. Where they're gonna have so the the final season,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:51]

I don't if it's airing right now or or whatever, but it's it's the next season that I haven't seen.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:55]

And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:56]

there are so many things to

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:59]

resolve,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:00]

and they're gonna they're gonna not resolve some things because it's Batman and resolution is just not part of the comic.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:06]

But they're

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:08]

they gotta, like, I think, close out some story lines, tie off some loose ends.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:12]

I just think it's neat to see all these

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:15]

villains really develop,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:17]

which the the emphasis is less on Bruce Wayne,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:20]

more on Jim Gordon and the villains themselves.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:24]

That's that's what I dig about it. Yeah. That's pretty cool.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:27]

It's it's got a weird

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:30]

visual style to it too because if you look,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:33]

there's a

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:34]

an aged element to it. Right? So there you don't ever see a modern car. They're all all those older boxier cars.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:43]

Nice. And a lot of the dress is like that, but it's very clearly set in,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:48]

like, current time.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:50]

So I don't I don't know what's up with that. People have got cell phones, but they drive old fashioned cars.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:54]

It's it's it's odd. But I I like it. It it works.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:00]

Alright. Semi

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:02]

classic to it.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:05]

Nice. It's on my list. I'll get around to it eventually.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:09]

On an infinite timeline. On an infinite timeline.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:14]

Alright. So I got I got the kayaks at the house. Oh, yeah?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:18]

Yeah. I went and picked them up. Nice.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:21]

I went out for a bike ride on Saturday

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:24]

in January. Yeah. It was, like, 52 degrees.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:28]

How

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:29]

far did you make it? I only went about 10 miles. Daylight was the killer there.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:35]

Were you feeling it?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:36]

I did feel it a little bit when I got home. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:40]

So you've not done any kind of inside riding at all. Right?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:43]

I do have, like, a stationary upright bike, but I haven't been on my actual bicycle inside. No.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:50]

Okay. Okay.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:52]

Yeah. So the leg's probably a little stiff, I would imagine.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:55]

It I think it was more my endurance.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:58]

Like, I went out riding like I did last time I went out when I was in shape.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:04]

I think I just pushed it a little too hard, especially since coming back home is all uphill. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:11]

Why why is there not a map for your ride? This is the ride you did on the fifth? Yeah. Because I did it on my

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:18]

on my watch. I didn't have Strava

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:20]

started.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:23]

Okay.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:24]

That's a bummer.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:27]

I went down around around Cedar Lake.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:30]

Yeah. I guess elevation would have been good.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:34]

Yeah. I've been I've done a couple stationary rides. I've not

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:38]

I've not put the bike outside, although we did it got up to, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:42]

55 yesterday.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:44]

I just I wasn't around when I coulda, you know, gotten out there to to do my thing.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:49]

But Yep.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:52]

Kayaks are here. I gotta figure out how to get them stored. They're just on sawhorses,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:57]

but they're waiting to be put into the water, John. So I look forward to your next visit.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:02]

I gotta bring my bike. Gotta go kayaking. Gotta get milkshakes.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:07]

Come on, Stan.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:09]

We we need the kayaks and the biking

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:11]

to cancel out all the milkshake consumption

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:14]

that we're Milkshakes and meatballs

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:17]

and Pop Tarts. Oh, yeah. Meatballs.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:19]

Meatballs, Pop Tarts.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:21]

It'll be great. It'll be glorious.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:24]

One day, Stan Yeah. This year, I will actually come visit because I don't plan on buying another house this year, and I'm hoping you aren't planning on buying another house this year. So Oh, no, man. I'm I'm not buying a house for a long time.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:38]

Anyway,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:39]

are we gonna do our best at twenty eighteen stuff?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:43]

I don't know. You got I I was gonna make a list that I never did.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:47]

I made a list.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:49]

I'm prepared. Oh, okay. Go for it, Johnny. Let's talk about your your best of 2018 list.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:55]

Yeah. So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:57]

you gave me five things,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:59]

so I narrowed it down to five. These may not actually be the top five, but they were the first that came to mind. Number one, I did buy a house in that whole process,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:09]

and that includes things like having a grill and a place to smoke my pipe. So that has been

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:16]

a

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:18]

great high point of twenty eighteen and now into 2019.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:22]

Is that three things or is that one? That's one thing.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:26]

Okay. Alright. Alright. It's a good number one. Buying a house, I dig it.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:30]

Number two,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:32]

started the life with a twist of lemon podcast.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:35]

Oh, John.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:37]

Because we've been talking about this for years,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:40]

and now,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:41]

I don't know. People seem to actually enjoy listening to us. I'm not entirely sure why,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:46]

but I saw a friend from high school when I was home over Christmas break,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:50]

and he had started listening. Got a text a few days later, said that he was now binge listening to us. So shout out to Kevin.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:59]

He loves the format, and we shouldn't change it. So there's that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:04]

Do we actually have a format?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:06]

Yeah. It's we're talking on the phone, Stan.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:09]

Okay. Alright. Alright. Let's let's roll with it.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:13]

Alright. That's number two. That was two. Three. Three was

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:16]

different vacations,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:18]

trips to the Dells, spent a week with my family in Wisconsin Dells in Central Wisconsin,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:23]

went to Louisville a couple times

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:26]

for Thanksgiving.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:27]

When Anna was on spring break, we went and spent

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:31]

the week with her grandparents down there. So that was nice to get away and take some breaks

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:37]

and hang out.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:41]

Four That's a good one.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:43]

Took up bicycling.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:46]

Finally.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:47]

Finally.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:49]

But Stan and I did not make it out on a ride with a bike of my own and me not riding Sarah's With a bike of your own. We did make it out on a ride.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:58]

Did make it excellent. '18. 2017,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:00]

Thanksgiving. Wasn't it? Wow. Yep. Alright.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:30:04]

And number five was kind of WordCamp US was a high point

**SPEAKER_1** [00:30:09]

and completed my first year with marketing

**SPEAKER_1** [00:30:12]

and design all the way back in March.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:30:14]

So coming up on year two here now. And it's fun to do something that you actually enjoy doing.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:22]

Good deal. That's a good five. I think if I were I'm gonna I'm gonna wing this.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:28]

If I were to think about my five, there'd be similar overlap in buying a house. Right? I bought a house in Indianapolis

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:35]

that, I think fits our family a little better in terms of just the way that it's laid out. It's also There's a Kohlmeyer suite?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:45]

It's got the Kohlmeyer suite. It has an actual place for guests to sleep as opposed to the loft in the open area.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:51]

So, yeah, that's that was a big one.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:55]

I took that Disney World trip this year,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:58]

which was pretty awesome.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:00]

And I especially like Disney World, so that was a it was a high point. I'm stoked at the possibility of

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:08]

maybe doing that again sometime sometime soon.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:11]

So I would I would make that probably number two.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:15]

I would say,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:16]

you know, we we changed churches as well in 2018,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:21]

and that was that worked out pretty well. I like I like how that kinda

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:25]

panned out. We got a nice little church family.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:29]

I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:30]

I bought a Mac

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:32]

Oh, yeah. Which was kinda the precursor

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:35]

to

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:36]

this podcast. Right? That was kinda the thing that tipped over

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:39]

your constant, hey, we should do this. Hey, we should do this. Right. Yep. We wanna talk about the new hardware

**SPEAKER_1** [00:31:45]

that coupled with me needing your advice as I was preparing to buy a house.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:50]

So Yeah. Exactly. So that that Mac laptop, I have

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:55]

used way more than I thought I would. I actually was afraid that it was gonna collect a lot of dust, but it has not.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:02]

And it just it really is a great product. Just in terms of Mac laptops I've owned over the years, really pleased with it. So that'd be number four.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:10]

And then number five,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:13]

I would say is Wileepalooza,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:17]

which,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:18]

you know, there are a lot of things here that relate to the podcast, which is why I'm not gonna single out the podcast. Although, that is a good one. But Wileepalooza is our ice cream shop of choice in Irvington,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:29]

and it also happens to make the best milkshake that I have had

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:33]

and has proper milkshake straws according to my kids. So Right. That would be, I think, my top five for 2018.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:40]

I can't possibly imagine how I'm going to top buying a house, going to Disney World, getting a Mac.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:47]

What else did I say? Finding a good church and

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:50]
