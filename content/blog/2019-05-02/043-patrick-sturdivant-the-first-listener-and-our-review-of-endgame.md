Listeners Assemble!

This is an exciting episode for Marvel and LWATOL fans alike. We're recording directly after not one but TWO showings of Avengers: Endgame. Around the Lemon dining room table sit Jon Kohlmeier and special guest Patrick Sturdivant. (We missed you Borghardt!).

Listen in as we talk about dinner at St. Elmo's Steakhouse, Avengers: Endgame, and some exciting moments in between.

There are spoilers. If you haven't seen Endgame and don't want it spoiled, DO NOT. We repeat DO NOT, listen to this episode until after you've seen it.

But it's been a week.. so what are you waiting for?

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon, Jon Kohlmeier and Patrick Sturdivant (The First Listener).
