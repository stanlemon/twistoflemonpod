Dear Listener,

We kick off this week's episode with a philosophical discussion on how Jon eats an ice cream Sunday. It doesn't quite reach the level of the great Grilled cheese debate of 2019, but it might get there.

Stan's WiFi woes aren't quite over. The Orbi setup sounded better than it panned out to be and Stan has since returned them and is back to the old router. He's found some cool tools and best practices for optimal WiFi coverage.

There are other things that have happened in the last week that have made Stan grumpy. Ultimately, I think it comes down to talking to too many customer support reps without resolution to his problems. Listen in to hear who he talked to and how each interaction went.

We discuss why personal banking is broken and why Stan is trying to streamline his finances.

Stan installed the Catalina beta, hear some of his initial reactions.

Thanks for listening!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
