Dear Listener,

We have a jam-packed episode today. All the potential of a great anniversary episode but we are still not at one year of Life with a Twist of Lemon.

To kick off the episode Jon had a couple of milkshakes on his trip. The first from Hubbard Avenue Diner with a strong showing. Their claim to fame is pie though.. so we talk about that a little bit too. Second milkshake was custard based from Oscars' in West Allis, WI. This was a less great custard milkshake.

Is this the end of Stan's Router Woes? He has a new TP-Link router that he's happy with so far.

Jon and Mrs. Kohlmeier spent some time this past weekend traveling and taking in the sites of Spring Green, WI. They Toured Frank Lloyd Wright's estate, Taliesin, and saw a performance of Macbeth at American Players Theatre.

New Mac news this week. We spend some time talking about 3D Touch and the new changes to the MacBook lines. That leads into a brief discussion on the MacBook Touch Bar.

Finally we close out the episode with a review of Spider-Man: Far From Home. Stan loved it. Jon went in with higher expectations. We drop spoilers. So if you haven't seen it, stop listening before we ruin it for you!

Thanks for Listening! Leave a review on iTunes if you're so inclined.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
