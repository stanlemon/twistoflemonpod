**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:00]

Dramas, please.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:13]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:20]

This is life

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:22]

with a twist of lemon.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:24]

Okay. Did you get that message?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:26]

I got that message. Now I gotta figure out how to use

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:30]

iCloud Drive.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:32]

Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. You don't use iCloud Drive?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:35]

No. Well, what I use iCloud Drive for?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:39]

For files?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:42]

Do are you I mean, like, I think that,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:45]

like, pages or something will save there when I'm on my phone and I have to open something.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:53]

Do you okay. I have

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:55]

I don't know where to start. Are you still using Dropbox? Is that is that what you're telling me? I do still use Dropbox.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:02]

Okay. Well Rarely. But, I mean, I don't put a ton of stuff in there. I do have all

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:07]

Life with Twist of Lemon stuff up there. But you do not use iCloud Drive at all. So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:16]

Not really. Okay. Well I back up to iCloud. Like, all my iOS devices get backed up to iCloud. My contacts sync over it, I guess. Is there a reason you don't use Drive, or is it just is it just not Never had a need, Stan. Okay. Well,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:32]

I shared with you the folder that I'm recording to, so now I don't have to send it to you in a text message.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:38]

And Does it does

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:41]

it give me a notification when it's done uploading? I I have no idea, John. I've believe it or not, I've not actually shared a folder with anybody who's changed something. I've shared a folder with missus Lemon, but she doesn't change anything, and she I don't even know that she has opened it. But yeah. Does

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:57]

she log in to Mint? I can't get in on the log in to Mint anymore.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:01]

So it's funny you ask.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:05]

Around,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:06]

oh,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:07]

April,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:08]

mid April,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:10]

she stopped logging in.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:12]

And I called her on it, and I think now it has become

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:16]

a a point of pride that she has not logged in.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:19]

Got it. Yeah. Always trying to make your life more difficult.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:23]

I mean, at this point, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:25]

I I don't know, man. With with COVID, we're spending such a little amount of money

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:30]

month to month that it it really doesn't matter. Like, I don't know. And she's also getting a more little more libertine. Like, she ordered elastic for making masks the other day and didn't even tell me beforehand.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:41]

So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:42]

You know what she should do? She should get some hair clippers for you because you're about to look like you need to buy a Harley and join

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:53]

sons of anarchy.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:54]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:55]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:55]

Here's a mess at the moment, yeah, it's it's getting kinda long.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:59]

I am I'm I think I'm still about a month away from my man bun.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:03]

Yeah. Yeah. Definitely got some gray in the beard. Oh, the beard's legit. I think I got length on you for beard. Yeah. You've been growing it longer. You got the whole That's true. Straight up hobbit thing going.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:14]

Hobbits can't grow facial hair, Stan. Oh. They only grow hair on their feet.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:18]

Dwarfs

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:19]

dwarfs.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:21]

Dwarfs. Dwarfs don't think of it. Oh, my word.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:24]

I guess I need to reread the book.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:27]

You

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:28]

do because that's like explicitly

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:30]

stated in there.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:33]

I and it's not a detail I remember. I I think in

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:37]

the other the other books with the elves,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:40]

the ones that I watched the movies for.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:44]

Haven't you watched all the movies now, or did I? No. I haven't watched a movies. I haven't watched the hobby yet. What is it? Lord of the Flies? Lord of the Rings. Lord Rings. Lord of the Flies is where they kill each other. Yeah. Not good.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:54]

Alright. So in the Lord of the Rings movies, I do remember that they were all clean shaven, but I thought maybe that was just a hygiene thing. I didn't realize that that was an anatomical limitation.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:04]

Yeah. Alright. Well Hairy feet.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:07]

No beards. I I got the hairy feet part. That's a little weird, but My big toe is hairy, so I I kinda understand, baby.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:15]

Are Anyway What are you drinking tonight, John? So I have bullet rye

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:20]

in a nice glass with a Death Star ice mold.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:25]

There you go. Has it cracked? I gotta figure out how to make a

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:29]

it it was a little cracked actually, but I have to figure out how to make this ice mold so that it's crystal clear. Something like you start with boiling water and something like that. I don't remember.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:41]

I that's not something I have striven for. I do know that when I use the reverse osmosis ice cubes or the reverse osmosis water,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:49]

the cubes come out clearer.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:51]

But yeah. Interesting.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:53]

I don't I don't know why that is. I it's Maybe that can be a running thing for the podcast. John's

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:58]

mission to get a clear

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:01]

dust star ice cube. Ice mold. I I think you should research this boiling water deal

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:07]

and get back to us. Alright.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:10]

Sounds good.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:11]

So that this long beard that you're sporting, you didn't happen to get that caught in any fan blades this week, did you?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:17]

No fan blades.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:19]

The problem was that the fan stopped, Stan.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:22]

So if I understand this correctly, I I got a message from you one morning

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:26]

asking if my father-in-law did service calls to Iowa. My father my father-in-law is HVAC guy, but he's retired,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:33]

and I I think Iowa was out of his range anyhow.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:36]

Yeah. Probably.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:37]

Six hours,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:38]

seven hours.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:40]

Something like that.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:43]

Yeah. So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:44]

my air conditioning died.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:47]

Anna was mentioning as we were going to bed, I think, like, last

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:51]

Tuesday.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:52]

It would have been before we recorded the or after we recorded the last episode.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:58]

So I don't know. But that she thought it was getting warm. And sure enough, I pull up my phone to check my

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:05]

ecobee,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:06]

see what the temperature is, and lo and behold, there's like this warning notification that says,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:12]

hey.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:13]

We see that the AC has been running for the last four hours, but the temperature continues to rise.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:19]

So that's a problem.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:20]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:21]

do you not have push notifications enabled for the the ecobee app?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:26]

I do not.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:27]

Okay.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:28]

I I know you're anti push notifications. I do. So my thing is, like, my phone is always on do not disturb.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:36]

So maybe they just didn't go to my watch, so I didn't notice.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:41]

I can't remember. This was a week ago. Has any of this maybe caused you to reevaluate the way in which you use your phone?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:48]

No. Not really. Okay.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:53]

You know what I use my phone for the most these days, Stan? Texting.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:57]

Playing command and conquer rivals.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:00]

You're still you're still on that?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:02]

I'm at level capstan.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:05]

I don't I don't know what that means.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:07]

So you go through and you level one through 60. I hit 60 and have capped out at 63 times now. I have not made it to Tiberium League yet, so that's the highest league that all the tournament players are at.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:20]

Okay. But there's I mean, there's still hope?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:24]

Sure. Okay. I gotta level up units. I ran out of resources.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:28]

Let's

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:29]

let's get back to the air conditioner. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:32]

So air conditioner went out, so I did what any new homeowner would do.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:38]

HVAC's places opened up the next day, and I started calling around.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:42]

First one,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:44]

like,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:45]

didn't answer forever

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:47]

and then put me on hold and then said they could come out, like, a week later.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:52]

Not good. The second one said It's been hot here. Has it been as hot there as it is here? Because it was, like, 92 today. Yeah. So it was it was pretty darn hot. We were in the nineties.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:02]

Today, we got up to 91,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:04]

I think, and it's been, like, hot early. So six in the morning, it's up at 82 degrees and humid. And so Yeah. Anyway,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:12]

so

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:13]

second one I called,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:15]

they were all on overtime,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:18]

so it was gonna cost me $200 just for somebody to come out before they actually

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:23]

fix the problem or did any service. So I was like, alright. I'll keep calling around. And if I can't find anybody, I'll call back.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:32]

Third one, next week.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:34]

The other one, I actually emailed because he was a connection of a work connection.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:39]

He is essentially retired, but I asked his

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:43]

advice on who to contact,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:46]

and he ended up getting to me after I ordered my part off Amazon.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:50]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:51]

Okay. But you, at some point, decided to diagnose this thing yourself?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:56]

I did. So I

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:59]

did what any good millennial would do, and then I took to the YouTubes.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:03]

So, basically, first thing I did was went out there. I on your on your phone. Right?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:08]

No. I don't watch YouTube. Or maybe I do watch YouTube on my phone. Yeah. Don't deny it. Don't deny it. As often as on my computer. Okay. But so, like, when it stopped,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:18]

and it wasn't 11:00 at night, I went out the next morning,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:22]

and I turned it back on. So I turned it off just because if it wasn't working, I wasn't gonna have it on. We opened up all the windows, ran some fans and stuff overnight, and that was fine. So the next morning, I went out, turned it on. There was a buzzing sound coming from the unit, but the big fan on top wasn't spinning.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:40]

So that gave me something to go off of. That's when I took to the YouTubes,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:45]

and they said, hey.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:47]

Go try to see if you can get the fan fan spinning with a long stick or something like that. So if you're hearing a buzzing,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:55]

go

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:56]

nick the fan and see if you can get it to spin. I did.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:00]

It spun,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:01]

then it stopped a little while later. Tried it again. Didn't work.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:05]

But, basically, that narrowed it down to being a capacitor problem,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:10]

which is this itty bitty

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:13]

cylinder thing that there's three sets of wires that go in it. It's like a dual run capacitor, so it runs the fan, and it runs the

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:21]

cooling unit.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:22]

Okay. So Something like that. So my wife would want me to ask you what the past was like, what the future was like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:28]

and if you get to see Doc Brown.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:31]

She did ask me that on my Facebook post,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:34]

and I think my response was that I didn't wanna deal with the Libyan terrorists.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:39]

So I I didn't go for the flux capacitor. It was just the dual run capacitor. Alright. Well,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:47]

you had your opportunity.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:49]

One of the greatest movies of all time.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:51]

So Yes. Definitely the greatest trilogy of all time.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:55]

Oh,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:56]

interesting.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:58]

We'll we'll we'll leave that for another podcast episode.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:02]

Because I I'll be honest with you. My initial reaction was Indiana Jones, but we'll come back to that. So Really? Yeah. Yeah. Really. I'm gonna add this to the next episode list right now.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:13]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:14]

you

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:16]

you were able to order the part on

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:21]

Amazon. Amazon. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:23]

And, I mean, what was the what was the repair like? Like, I mean, swapping it out.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:29]

Yeah. So, like, I wasn't completely convinced that this was the issue, but the part was $17. So I figured, why not try it, especially if people aren't gonna be out here till next week? It's cheaper than 200.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:40]

And it came the next day. So I think I ordered on Tuesday. It came on Wednesday before lunch with the mail.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:46]

So over lunch on Wednesday,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:49]

I went out there with my,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:51]

trusty

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:52]

cordless power drill that Stan talked me into buying when I became a homeowner,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:57]

took off

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:58]

12 bolts.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:01]

Sounds sounds about right. Panel off, and then there were two more bolts kinda hiding the

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:06]

control panel, I guess.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:09]

And then, yeah, it was just pull off the wires and put them on the right post on the new one.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:17]

So they're basically

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:19]

four wires

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:20]

that go on three different posts.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:23]

And now, of course, I turned off my electricity and pulled the disconnect

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:29]

and

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:30]

shorted out the capacitor,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:32]

and then I even used that other

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:35]

I don't know what it's called. The pen the current Yep. Pen or whatever that's.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:39]

So I used that to make sure that I wasn't gonna kill myself,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:43]

but it turns out I wouldn't have killed myself anyway. Just it would've hurt.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:47]

Yeah. Little little bit of a single. So I was gonna ask, literally, right, as you were about to you were starting to say this, I was like, did you kill the power, John?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:54]

Yeah. I mean, that was part of the first troubleshooting step too was I

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:59]

toggled the breaker switch, checked the breaker switch, and stuff like that. That's

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:03]

when I got the buzzing noise. So, yes, I killed the power.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:08]

Turned the power back on before I put it all together,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:12]

and made sure that it was running. You felt pretty good about yourself, didn't you?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:17]

I did. I mean, the repair took me a total of fifteen minutes and cost me

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:23]

$17,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:24]

$18.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:25]

Well, there you go.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:27]

Over lunch. This is also a pro to remote working. Oh, because you can fix your AC at any time of the day. The the pro You can you can be productive over lunchtime without

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:37]

killing all your time. The pro to office work is somebody else has to fix the AC while you're eating lunch, John. In the office. Yeah. Sure. Yeah. At home, that wouldn't help me. I'd just be stressing about it. So I didn't I didn't have any home repairs this last week, but I did get into a little bit of electrical work. I don't know if you remember

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:55]

me telling you about my my sense

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:59]

energy monitor that I have and how I have Yeah. I have two feeds into the house. I've got a 20 and a 10,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:05]

and the sense only came with,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:09]

their their clamps, really,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:11]

for one panel at a time. And so I've been monitoring the downstairs in the basement, but not the upstairs.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:18]

Well,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:19]

most of not the upstairs. There are a couple things that are actually on the breakers for the the 20 panel.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:25]

However, recently, Sense,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:28]

actually added support

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:30]

to their device

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:31]

to use the solar feed. So there's a there's a a feed on the unit, the monitoring unit,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:37]

for taking

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:38]

special clamps for solar panels.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:42]

And they basically

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:43]

came up with a set of clamps that would go into the solar panel,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:47]

input and then updated the the firmware on the device to support

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:51]

being able to read a second panel. So yesterday,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:54]

popped everything off because I gotta remove the faceplates of both panels, and I added the new clamps, got it all hooked up while I was grilling dinner.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:03]

So in between in between flipping meat, I was doing stuff, and I got it back on. So I've been I've been monitoring the whole house, and

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:12]

thus far as from what I can tell,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:14]

the upstairs used

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:16]

as little energy as I thought it did.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:19]

So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:15:20]

So when Evelyn decides that she's gonna come up with this

**SPEAKER_1** [00:15:24]

massive plot for a weapon of mass destruction,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:15:27]

like, you're gonna be able to cut that off right at the beginning?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:30]

Yes. And so here here's the other thing too. I I threatened all the kids yesterday, as a loving father would.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:37]

I I told them that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:39]

the sense has the ability to detect lights in the house. Like, I I can I've I've singled out certain lights already in the home and that I was going to spend the time and arguably the money on electricity

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:53]

to ensure that each of their lights was singled out and identified by scents so that I could then detect it in the future because they are notorious for leaving their lights on.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:01]

And,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:03]

they laughed. I thought this was funny.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:05]

But what I realized is the EchoBee

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:08]

has a motion detector,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:11]

and I have a couple spare sensors

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:14]

and could position them in their rooms.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:19]

And then, you know, we we track their like, the jobs they do around the house in an app called rooster money.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:26]

And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:27]

I I I just told them, like, I will use the echo beater to detect whether or not they're present. And when the light has been on too long, I will deduct money from their rooster money. So trying to put the fear of God into it. I'm

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:38]

confident that I could code this up. I'm just hoping that I won't have to out of out of pure fear.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:16:45]

Nice. Have you considered just investing in, like, smart light fixtures?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:50]

I have, and it may come to that. It very well may come to that, but they Just just turn it off every five minutes.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:58]

So funny story,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:01]

actually. Yes. I guess yesterday or the day before, whenever I was doing the sense monitor, I had to flip the the main

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:07]

off on the panel. Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:09]

The kids did not notice the fact that the lights went out, the fan stopped swinging, the air conditioner stopped blowing air. Didn't notice any of that. I have my Internet,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:18]

all hooked up on UPS,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:22]

boxes. Right? So the one that comes into the house as well as the router. So it takes fifteen to twenty minutes before,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:28]

you know, the Internet will actually go out. The problem is I was grilling meat, and so I was jumping back and forth between things. And so this little job took just long enough for those batteries to go out, and all three of the kids came out mad, like legitimately mad.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:42]

Want to know why the Internet was out because they were in the middle of their one hour of Minecraft time that they have, and all three of them were world building.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:53]

Nice.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:54]

Yeah. So Did you tell them that back in your day, you have to listen to dial tones, and it would take twenty minutes just to connect to the Internet? I I don't think it would resonate. Or or yeah. Or or the worst

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:06]

the worst wasn't wasn't the connect like, the dial up and, like, getting connected and how slow it was. The worst was when your sister

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:13]

would go and pick up the other phone and then start hitting buttons.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:16]

Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:17]

Because then, you know, you'd be on AOL or whatever, Prodigy, and then suddenly, boop, you're off the Internet, you have no idea why.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:24]

And this is this is before an app remembered what you were doing. So I don't know if you remember old AOL, AOL 2.5.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:29]

Right? Like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:31]

it when it lost the connection, everything you were doing was gone. All of it. Yep.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:36]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:18:37]

Back when he used to run them off the free CDs.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:40]

Oh, gosh.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:44]

Back in the day. Back in the day. Man,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:18:47]

we're so old.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:49]

Well, I'll tell you what, AOL, that I mean, that that is a blast from the past. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:54]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:54]

Speaking of blast from the past, John,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:57]

did you watch Hamilton?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:00]

I did. We watched it on the third, the evening of the third when it released.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:06]

Friday night is historically movie night in the Colmire household.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:09]

No homemade pizza, though. But we watched Hamilton.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:14]

I have been very familiar with the soundtrack since you first started sending me songs, and I didn't understand

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:20]

why you were sending them to me. Then I went all in on the soundtrack.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:25]

Missus Kollmeyer also listened to the soundtrack in full, although she might have fell asleep on it on one of our trips to Louisville.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:33]

But yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:35]

Does she enjoy the soundtrack as much as you do at this point?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:41]

Probably not. Does she sing along with the songs ever?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:46]

No. Definitely not. Alright. Does she sing along with any songs?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:50]

Sometimes. Okay. It's kind of rare. But Like Justin Bieber?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:19:55]

No. Her Ed Sheeran is her guy. Uh-huh. There you go. Okay.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:00]

I should've called that. I should've called that. She looks like an Ed Sheeran fan. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:05]

you had not seen the musical in person. I had. I also watched it July 3.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:11]

I remember reading the announcement that Disney was going to do this, and I thought to myself that they were special recording it. Is that what you thought?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:20]

No. I thought it was just a

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:23]

live

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:24]

recording.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:24]

Okay.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:25]

So I I didn't put that together. I was excited because it's the original cast. I did not see the original cast. The original cast is the one that's on the recorded album.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:35]

This

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:36]

recording was actually done four years ago in 2016.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:40]

Disney secured the rights to it and released it. This is actually Lin Manuel Miranda

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:47]

and and all of the the folks on the album that everybody sings to.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:52]

Yep. Original Broadway cast. The original Broadway cast. Lin Manuel Miranda

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:57]

wrote, and I guess he directed it as well.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:01]

That I do not know. Yeah. I'm not sure about that. Probably. But I mean, directors don't do

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:07]

like, they do a lot during rehearsal, but once the show hits, it's all stage managers. Yeah. So So this this is his baby, and it was based off of a book by Ron Chernow,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:18]

you know, about Alexander Hamilton.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:20]

And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:22]

I I find the music very catchy. I I loved it because it's a great story. It's history. It's, like, relatively accurate too.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:33]

I don't know. Besides me sending you songs, what got you interested in Hamilton, John?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:38]

So, I mean, overall, I'm a theater person. Like,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:42]

Anna and I will go see theater shows and visit Frank Lloyd Wright

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:47]

designs,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:48]

and that's kind of what we do as a couple. But I got into the theater in high school.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:54]

One of my best friends teaches

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:57]

second instruction out in Irvine, California.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:00]

So, like, I've been around theater for the better part of fifteen years. So here's the thing, though. When I look at you and I think the kind of theater you go to see, it's gonna be like

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:10]

Guys and Dolls, Phantom of the Opera, The Music Man.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:15]

I don't I don't think of you as like

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:17]

as

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:18]

example, I would never imagine you going to see Rent. Just doesn't seem like a thing you'd go to see. I have never seen Rent, the movie or otherwise. I did see Wicked on Broadway, not the original Broadway cast, but I saw it on Broadway in New York and Broadway Chicago.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:35]

So I would never pegged you for seeing Wicked. So I guess where I'm where I'm trying to get here is is Hamilton in

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:41]

the, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:43]

genre of

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:44]

stagecraft that you would have even engaged with?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:48]

So, generally, if it's not, like, obscene shows,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:53]

I mean, I'm interested in any of it. What what do you mean by obscene? Like, the content?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:58]

Yeah. The content, like nudity on stage and stuff like that. Well, John, I think I think you look at different playlistings than I do.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:07]

Oh. Popular theater shows, Stan.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:11]

Like, our community theater has done stuff like that. So Really? Well, the things you never knew about Iowa.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:20]

No. But, like, I've seen everything from

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:23]

actually, the coolest one of the coolest shows was,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:26]

the last night of doctor Faustus.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:29]

And it was a one man show, and it was in, like, this abandoned warehouse in Milwaukee.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:34]

And it was just this real intimate setting.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:36]

That wasn't musical. It's just a one man

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:39]

monologue, basically, but that was very cool.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:43]

So as a married adult,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:44]

I don't think we've seen much theater. While we were in Chicago as an engaged couple, we

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:51]

saw a show, maybe two. I don't I don't honestly remember.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:56]

I think I've seen I think I I feel like I've seen both Rent and Wicked with Sarah,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:03]

but

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:05]

it's not been really a thing that we've done. Missus Lemon was all about the theater life,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:09]

singing, dancing, wearing,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:11]

you know, costumes and all that jazz. That was definitely not my jam, though I did in high school enjoy

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:17]

attending Shakespeare

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:18]

theater. So, you know, take it with a grain of salt.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:23]

Suffice to say,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:24]

Hamilton was not something I was even remotely interested in. I even tried listening to it on a flight once to try just to, like, wrap my head around what people were into.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:34]

It wasn't until a summer trip with my family. My wife was all into it, and my kids had started to, like, pick up on some of the songs.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:42]

And then I I started paying attention. Right? And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:46]

the the interest in in just history drew me in.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:51]

It's just well crafted, and it also combines a genre of music that I like, which is, you know, rap and hip hop.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:59]

And and I'm definitely not used to that from a theater perspective. So all this to Yeah. Say I mean, this is all

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:06]

crazy in the theater world. Yeah. So I think it's even more crazy when you see it because well, so first of all, the album is

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:16]

literally, like, 98%

**SPEAKER_1** [00:25:18]

of the show. K? Yeah. I was very surprised by that. Yeah. There's there's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:23]

a a particular, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:26]

exchange

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:27]

with a little bit of singing

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:29]

around Lawrence's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:30]

death

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:31]

that is not on the album. And Lin Manuel

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:34]

Miranda talks about all this. Like, I I knew that going to go see it. Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:39]

And I went and saw it. Gosh. I don't know. Was that a year or two ago, John? I don't even remember. I saw it in Chicago. Yeah. And I think I told you that but we had good seats. I they were they

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:50]

were not cheap, but we had good seats.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:53]

The thing that I was the most disappointed by was

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:59]

I'm gonna drop blank on his name. I would the the lack of George Washington. Yeah. Christopher Jackson. Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:05]

So Christopher Jackson's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:06]

voice is

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:08]

epic, and it is so full. It has such a a dynamic range to it. And the gentleman that we saw play George Washington was he was great. Like, he he would've been I would've loved him if I didn't know who Christopher Jackson was.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:21]

Right.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:24]

So, yeah, I was looking forward having already seen this, I was looking forward to just seeing the original cast because mainly Christopher Jackson.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:32]

I am curious,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:34]

who who stood out to you the most in the in the 2016 recording that's on Disney plus?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:42]

So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:43]

I would say that hands down,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:46]

the best vocalist

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:48]

in the 2016

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:49]

Disney plus version

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:51]

is

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:52]

Philip Felipe Sue.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:56]

Who plays Eliza.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:58]

Eliza Hamilton. Yeah. Skyler Hamilton. Skyler Hamilton. Yeah. So I think I actually agree with you. I I would say this, the the trifecta of the Skyler sisters

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:08]

was so much stronger.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:12]

You could just release you could tell that these

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:15]

parts were crafted for them. Right? Like, there are harmonies that are in the musical

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:20]

because of those ladies in in their, like, dress rehearsal rooms, you know, just jamming out. Right? Like like Lin Manuel Miranda heard that and then,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:29]

you know, built out the the music for them.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:32]

And I think that is so much more clear

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:35]

in the recording than the the piece that I saw.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:40]

I was I was honestly, I was a little disappointed with Leslie Odom junior. I I don't know. So was I. He must have been it was off because,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:48]

like, I've seen live recordings of him before, and he can belt it. And he does on the soundtrack, then you don't expect it to be like the soundtrack.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:56]

Well, he yeah. No. You you I mean, you can't. Right? But Right. He he also, though I think he was stronger

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:04]

in the second half of the show.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:06]

That it's it's really the like, I don't know, first

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:10]

five songs

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:12]

of the the musical where

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:15]

he's not singing, at least in this recording, he's shouting, and it just it I don't know. Yeah. It was a little bit of a letdown.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:21]

So the other thing that I noticed with him was I expected him to be a stronger actor than he was too.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:27]

And, like, being with these close-up

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:29]

recordings,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:30]

like,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:32]

you see everything, which isn't necessarily the

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:35]

stage actor's strong point. But Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:38]

No. I think that's a good point. I I think his so I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:42]

agree with you with this one caveat.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:45]

There is anger in his face in parts of this

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:49]

performance

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:51]

that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:52]

really helps tell the story. Like, visually, that was one thing that really stood out to me.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:58]

Generally, yeah, I think I think you're totally right. Like, it's it's not really

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:01]

he's not an actor.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:03]

You even commented about this when we were live texting this.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:06]

Lin Manuel Miranda, though,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:08]

is so expressive

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:10]

throughout this entire performance.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:12]

Maybe that's because he wrote it. I don't know. But I like Yeah. I mean, he there's definitely investment there. I mean, he spent seven years of his life writing this thing.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:20]

But,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:21]

like,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:22]

he does not have

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:24]

a strong voice. He doesn't have a Broadway caliber voice. And

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:29]

it works in this case because he surrounded himself with so many great singers

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:34]

that he can kinda slough it off. But I was utterly surprised

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:39]

with how good of an actor he was, especially in the in the second half Yep. With the kind of his whole life falling apart. Right.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:48]

And, you know, was interesting. So, again, there are things that you can see in the original Broadway cast that you

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:56]

you you just won't in any cast that's doing this subsequently.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:00]

The other thing is that some of those close-up shots,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:03]

I think, also helped a lot. One of the things that has always puzzled me was in the second half of the show,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:11]

Lin Manuel Miranda's voice

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:14]

has I don't it sounds like a it's just a a a weird

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:19]

higher pitched sound to it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:23]

And I finally realized watching this why

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:26]

his voice is different. And I'm thinking really, like, post,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:30]

Reynolds' pamphlet. Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:32]

Post Reynolds pamphlet, his voice is distinctively different. And it's because if if you see him in the show, he's he's literally choked up holding back tears the whole time.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:41]

Right. Right? He's an emotional Hamilton.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:43]

And and that is the that is something that really, like, struck me with the recording because you you

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:50]

don't like, if you pay attention to the story, you understand what's going on, maybe you could infer that, but it is definitely not as clear as when watching it.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:30:58]

Yep.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:30:59]

Yeah. So I've seen several

**SPEAKER_1** [00:31:02]

live stage recordings,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:31:04]

and this, by far, was the best one I've ever seen as far as production value and just

**SPEAKER_1** [00:31:11]

filmography,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:12]

really. Yeah. Oh, it yeah. It was fantastic. It's when I saw it in person,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:17]

I remember being amazed at how simple

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:20]

the actual

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:22]

stage is. Right? Like, this the there's not a lot going on there. It's all about costumes and people and the fact that the floor moves in two different ways. Right? But apart from that, there's really not a lot going on. They don't they don't spend a lot of time

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:37]

on

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:38]

secondary sets. Right? Like, it's it's the the primary when the stage

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:43]

lights come on, and that's all you got. And it I think it works.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:47]

It's just fascinating.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:48]

The the story really drives it's very different than anything I've seen. So so do I mean, contrasted to, like, fan of the opera. Right? Where Sure. Where the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:58]

the stage and the sets are, like, such a huge factor in the whole thing.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:03]

I think it's worth calling out. I'm gonna I'm gonna botch his name, David Diggs.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:09]

Right? So Lafayette,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:10]

also,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:11]

Thomas Jefferson,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:13]

who I think he might have,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:16]

done the the Lafayette rap there in, what is that? That's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:22]

is that Yorktown?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:23]

I think he might have actually done it faster

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:26]

in

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:26]

the 2016 recording than on

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:29]

the album.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:31]

And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:32]

his his whole, like, mannerisms, his expressions are awesome.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:37]

They're they're just they're very

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:39]

they're flamboyant in a way that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:41]

really paints a picture for these characters because Lavetta is a really flamboyant character in the actual history. And Thomas Jefferson is like I mean, he's a he's a if you read about Thomas Jefferson, he's a goofball. He's a dork. He's eccentric.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:55]

And Diggs brings that out.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:59]

Interestingly

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:00]

too, though,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:01]

I think

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:03]

and saw this, Jonathan Groff is just out of this world.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:07]

Yep.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:09]

He he really is. Everything

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:11]

from the voice to

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:14]

facial expressions

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:15]

to

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:17]

stage presence,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:19]

even. Like, now it helps that he is the only one who was, like, in

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:24]

actual

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:26]

time appropriate costume. Like, he's the only one who wears a wig even though the Hamilton Jefferson stuff,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:33]

and, like, he doesn't move around and dance as much as all these others.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:37]

But yeah. Well, he's he's so still. Now I will say the the show that I like, physically still, he he picks a place on the stage, and he stays there.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:46]

The the show that I saw in Chicago had a pretty good King George.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:51]

But Jonathan Groff, man, he's just off the chart. And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:55]

I think

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:56]

I didn't and I I probably

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:59]

I I don't know why, but I did not notice this when I saw it in person,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:04]

how he stays on stage in that that, like, tail end.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:08]

Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:10]

And if you watch him while he's on stage, after he's done with his last song,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:15]

he's just so expressive. It's it's I think what is it? It's after I know him.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:19]

Right? Yep.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:20]

And he just lingers around. It's it's hilarious.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:24]

What what got me, what I couldn't believe is the man has got a serious sputum problem. Like, the amount of saliva

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:31]

that was flying off of his face. Can you imagine cleaning that costume?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:37]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:38]

It's interesting that you noticed that. I did not. Oh, man. On the on the 70 inch television on the 70 inch television Yeah. True.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:46]

There was a point at which he looked like he was drooling on himself. I think this was

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:51]

what was it? It was probably during

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:55]

what's the Slada Dotti Das?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:58]

No. It was when he was I think it was during What Comes Next.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:02]

And he gets he gets, like, flustered, and there's like, he it looks like he's drooling.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:07]

And all of a sudden, he just he purses his lips, and it flips off. And I thought, oh my word. Where did that land? You know?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:16]

Well, you know, Stan, reindeers are better than people. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:20]

It's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:21]

such a wild range.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:23]

Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:24]

Yep. Rangers are better than people to,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:27]

I will kill your friends and family.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:30]

It's it's just great. To remind you of my love. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:35]

So that's something else we should talk about. So, like, there's lots of, like, musical people who

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:41]

weren't didn't get it. Like, they don't understand this because it's not really a sing along musical as much as you like to sing along with it, Stan, but it's not singing in the rain or

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:53]

it's a hard knock knock life or something like that.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:57]

So, like, what is it? There's

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:59]

an insane amount of words

**SPEAKER_1** [00:36:02]

in this musical. It's, like, 10 times the

**SPEAKER_1** [00:36:05]

I don't know. I'm pulling 10 out of my brain, but 10 times the amount of words as in other Broadway musicals.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:11]

It's because I mean, it's a story. Right? It's a story with a ton of historical factual detail that has been packed in in a in a really truly creative way. I think you're right. It's not a sing along in the sense that singing in the rain is. It is a sing along in the sense that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:28]

this is there's a

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:31]

it's not pure hip hop. Right? It's not like chart topping hip hop or chart topping rap,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:36]

but it has these tones of this music,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:40]

these these genres, these styles interwoven

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:43]

that I think connects in a in in just a very different way. It's it's there's also a very

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:48]

natural colloquial way of speaking, but with very clever rhymes.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:36:53]

The other thing that every time I listen so I I'm bad about, like, I'm gonna listen to helpless right now, and then Yorktown, and then I'm gonna go back to,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:02]

you know,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:03]

you'll be back, and then, you know, the Aaron Burst or whatever. Like, I'll jump around. But when you listen to this thing from start to finish, one of the things that you realize

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:13]

is

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:14]

Lin Manuel Miranda has taken

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:17]

pieces of music, and he's taken words and he's That's absolutely genius.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:22]

Yeah. It it really is. You just think about, like I remember the the first time Sarah ever this is this is I'm almost ashamed to to admit this. The first time that Sarah played the opening song Alexander Hamilton to me, I was like I I said, it's such a pathetic way that he introduces himself,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:38]

You know? Right. He says he says Alexander Hamilton in the, like, softest, most pathetic

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:43]

way possible.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:45]

But then you contrast that with, you know, going into the second act and all of that, and it's it's night and day different. Or, like, you know, the the presence of nonstop.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:56]

Right? And and that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:37:58]

that rift that that just permeates through or even

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:02]

stay alive.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:04]

Right? Yep. Think of think of all the times that you hear stay alive, the hurricane theme, the way that that translates to the the physical

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:11]

stage.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:38:12]

Man, that whole

**SPEAKER_1** [00:38:14]

yeah. That was awesome. That was Anna's favorite scene, I think. Anytime

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:18]

that they got the stage moving in both directions.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:22]

Right? Because there's two there are two discs on the floor,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:26]

and they rotate in opposite directions. Anytime that they were leveraging both those,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:30]

the intensity the story was at a at a really high point, and they used it

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:35]

really

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:36]

intimately tied with the words. So, you know, hurricane

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:39]

was a was a big one. There's a little bit of it in

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:44]

satisfied.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:45]

The the rewind?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:38:47]

Yep. Oh, man. That like, satisfied is a great song. When you see satisfied,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:38:52]

it is so much better. Yeah. I mean, they they

**SPEAKER_1** [00:38:56]

the blocking there,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:38:58]

it's identical.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:38:59]

Yeah. Like, identical to the first time through. It was it was really well done.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:39:05]

Satisfied is really when I started to notice

**SPEAKER_1** [00:39:09]

how on point the sound guys were. Yep. Because there's this little part that's recorded at the beginning,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:39:16]

which

**SPEAKER_1** [00:39:16]

I guess makes sense because it's

**SPEAKER_1** [00:39:19]

very,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:39:20]

effect y, I guess. Yep. So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:39:23]

but I ran sound in high school, so I noticed that stuff, and I noticed lighting. Lighting was also on point Yep. Which I guess you expect from a Broadway show.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:39:31]

I mean I mean, you do. I think the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:39:34]

I I don't know. There's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:39:36]

there is a

**SPEAKER_0** [00:39:38]

they use lighting to call attention to things in a very stark way. The contrast is very

**SPEAKER_0** [00:39:44]

clear. And I think I think it's just it's so much more crisp,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:39:49]

and, again, so much more attached to the story.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:39:52]

Last thing on Satisfied, I'll just say this. The it's not like, Satisfied is not my favorite song

**SPEAKER_0** [00:39:57]

on the album. I'm as you know, I'm a sucker for helpless.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:01]

Helpless is my favorite to, like, sing along to.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:04]

The the thing is when you watch that first act, satisfied might actually be

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:10]

my favorite

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:11]

on stage in the first act. It it's just Sure. Again,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:15]

the visuals the visuals really put over the top. So and I think I think satisfied for me is is the takeaway for this. If you love this musical, if you love the soundtrack, whatever, and you're like, do I really wanna splurge on 200 to go see it in person?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:29]

Well, you know, maybe maybe watch it on

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:32]

on Disney plus because subscription's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:34]

cheaper. But I think their songs look satisfied.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:38]

Performances like Jon Groff's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:41]

really, like I said, the performances

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:43]

on Chicago,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:44]

King George was was just as, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:47]

out there and telling in terms of, like, his dynamic on the stage. Those are the things that I think really

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:53]

make you wanna take

**SPEAKER_0** [00:40:55]

this and go see it in person.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:40:58]

Yeah. I mean,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:41:00]

definitely,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:41:01]

just go see theater in person.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:41:03]

Hamilton,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:41:04]

great. If it's anything else, just go see live theater. It's such a different

**SPEAKER_1** [00:41:09]

medium than anything else that we have.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:41:12]

And it's raw, and it's live,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:41:16]

and they tell great stories that tell you something about yourself usually. Tell me how you feel about cats.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:41:21]

I've never seen cats either.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:41:23]

I haven't I definitely did not watch the movie. I don't plan on watching the movie. Oh, man. I you know what? If cats comes out free to, like, HBO Max or something, I'll I'll give it a go. I'll put it on the background.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:41:35]

Oof.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:41:36]

What's up? You

**SPEAKER_0** [00:41:38]

know what my favorite song was? That that was the next thing I was gonna ask. So tell me.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:41:43]

The story of tonight because I'm a sucker for this camaraderie stuff and Yep.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:41:48]

Toasting beers and yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:41:51]

Well, you know what's interesting too about the story of tonight?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:41:55]

The dynamic between

**SPEAKER_0** [00:41:57]

Hamilton

**SPEAKER_0** [00:41:57]

and Burr at that moment

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:00]

is as jovial and as friendly as it's going to be the whole the whole

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:06]

show. Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:07]

Yep. And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:09]

I think you get some of the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:12]

that that camaraderie

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:14]

really through Lin Manuel Miranda's expressions. Like, less less Leslie Odom, but more through Lin Manuel Miranda.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:21]

And,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:23]

yeah, I mean, it's a fun song too. I listen. Any any

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:26]

any song that involves Hercules Mulligan,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:29]

I'm all about it.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:42:31]

I'm all about it. Oh, like him more than Madison?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:34]

Well, so so this is this is interesting. Right? Like, I would say watching the Disney plus, the performance again, like, in person is in person. It's it's always gonna be fantastic.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:44]

You can't it's not gonna ever compete with watching it even on my 70 inch television.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:51]

Christopher Jackson, way better than the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:55]

the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:42:56]

George Washington that I saw. Right? Hands down. Sure. I would say King George,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:01]

you know, comparable.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:03]

Hercules Mulligan,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:05]

way better in Disney plus. James Madison,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:08]

way better in Chicago.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:10]

Yeah. And and I I was trying to figure out what it is. And, you know, if you know anything about James Madison from history, right, he's a puny character. He's he's constantly sick. He's got the sniffles.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:21]

And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:22]

I'm drawing a blank on this guy's name now. Is that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:26]

oh, this is gonna kill me. The

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:29]

the guy who plays

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:32]

oh, John. What is his name? What is his name? Google it, Stan. I'll buy you some time. Okay.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:38]

I'll I'll look it up. I'll leave it later. I don't I don't wanna I don't wanna draw But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:42]

that performer does a fantastic Hercules Mulligan and an and I would say a mediocre at best,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:48]

James Madison. Now his voice is awesome,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:50]

but his acting James Madison,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:52]

I I thought was actually inferior to the the performer I saw who really,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:43:58]

I think, showed you that this is a weak like, a physically weak human being.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:44:03]

And the the actor on the original Broadway cast, I mean, he's he's a stout dude, and he walks with his chest out.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:44:11]

And there's nothing about James Madison in history that would lead anyone to believe

**SPEAKER_0** [00:44:17]

that that,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:44:19]

you know, he carries himself like that. So you know? So not being a history buff, like, just the changing character I thought was very skillful for everyone who changed characters between act one and act two, which I think is another part of the genius of

**SPEAKER_1** [00:44:36]

the writing of Hamilton. Absolutely. Like, basically, all of Hamilton's friends or acquaintances

**SPEAKER_1** [00:44:43]

are his enemies in the second act.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:44:45]

I'm

**SPEAKER_0** [00:44:47]

not gonna be able to pronounce this guy's name. It looks like he goes by Oak for short. Oak Onodon

**SPEAKER_0** [00:44:52]

Onodon

**SPEAKER_0** [00:44:53]

I'm sorry. I'm so bad at this.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:44:57]

Is is who played Hercules Mulligan and James Madison.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:45:01]

Fantastic voice.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:45:02]

Great.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:45:03]

Oh, man. Him as Hercules Mulligan you know how much I love

**SPEAKER_0** [00:45:07]

Hercules Mulligan in

**SPEAKER_0** [00:45:09]

in but is it

**SPEAKER_0** [00:45:12]

is it Guns N Ships where he really no. It's Yorktown.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:45:16]

Right? Yep. Yeah. Yeah. Yorktown. Got a spy on the inside. Yep. Hercules Mulligan.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:45:23]

Fox, it's just It's interesting to note that they bleeped out all

**SPEAKER_1** [00:45:28]

three or four f bombs in the show on the Disney plus version.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:45:31]

Yeah. And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:45:33]

I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:45:34]

you know? Keep the PG 13 rating. Yeah. Keep the PG gosh, man. It had to have been right on the line. You know?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:45:42]

I I don't know. Like, the Reynolds stuff

**SPEAKER_1** [00:45:45]

acted out on stage was not as bad as I thought it was going to be.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:45:49]

Well, I I will say this. It was a little more tame than what I saw

**SPEAKER_0** [00:45:53]

in Chicago.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:45:55]

So my my kids to this day have not seen,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:46:00]

what is it? I don't they haven't seen the Adams or they haven't heard, rather, the Adams administration,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:46:05]

we know, hurricane, or the Reynolds pamphlet.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:46:07]

Those four songs, they have not heard.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:46:10]

I they've I don't think they've seen Burn either or heard Burn. And Burn Burn is an Burn is an amazing song.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:46:16]

Yeah. I mean, that's one of the things that like, the show is really about Eliza Hamilton, not Alexander. Like, if you go through it. Yeah. Oh, well, there's definitely it's definitely a big component to it for for sure. Burn is just it's it's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:46:30]

a it's a great song. Her voice is

**SPEAKER_0** [00:46:33]

unbelievable.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:46:34]

She really shines there.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:46:37]

And I again, I think on stage just accentuates

**SPEAKER_1** [00:46:40]

all that. She's

**SPEAKER_1** [00:46:41]

twenty sixteen, she was early twenties.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:46:44]

I have no idea. Doing all this? I have no idea, John.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:46:48]

Let's look Crazy man. Philip Sue Philippa Sue.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:46:52]

Oh, gosh. This killing me. She was born in 1990. She's 30 years old now. Yeah. So she's a year younger than me. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:00]

What what have you done with your life, John? Were you Eliza Skyler in a Broadway musical?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:47:04]

I have never acted

**SPEAKER_1** [00:47:06]

on stage outside of grade school when I was forced to.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:12]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:14]

So so bottom line, like, you

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:17]

know,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:19]

going into this this could sound so weird. Going into this, I was thinking to myself that I would really enjoy Angelica's performance.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:27]

And it it it's She was good. Yeah. She's good. Phenomenal. She's good. But you're right. Philippa Sue

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:33]

just

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:34]

she leads that trio.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:36]

And,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:38]

mean,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:38]

she's she's fantastic.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:40]

There's no way around it. And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:43]

I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:44]

yeah. Oh, you know, so another one that I really liked was Lawrence.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:49]

Yeah. So, you know, I like, I him in the first act, I don't I really don't care for him as

**SPEAKER_0** [00:47:57]

what what is Alexander Hamilton's kid's name?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:48:00]

Philip. Yeah. Philip. Philip Hamilton.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:48:02]

I I don't care for him in that role. Don't care for that role at all in this entire musical. Like, I think the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:48:09]

the only good part out of the song that he plays with mom

**SPEAKER_0** [00:48:13]

on the piano

**SPEAKER_0** [00:48:14]

is the echoes you get of it when he dies. Right? So that's that's that's in take a break.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:48:20]

And then

**SPEAKER_1** [00:48:23]

Yeah. I mean,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:48:25]

like, even his duel scene is I mean, it's integral to the story, and his character is integral to the story.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:48:32]

But, yeah, overall, the character is not that strong. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:48:35]

But in the first act, as Lawrence, I I just I love

**SPEAKER_0** [00:48:39]

the songs. I love his voice, his level of engagement. You know? It's just it's great. So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:48:46]

I enjoyed it, that your

**SPEAKER_1** [00:48:48]

in laws would enjoy Hamilton?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:48:51]

I have no idea. You know, they've heard quite a bit of Hamilton

**SPEAKER_0** [00:48:54]

from the kids because my kids will walk around,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:48:58]

you know, singing and rap and

**SPEAKER_0** [00:49:01]

especially Aaron Burster. I don't know what it is about Aaron Burster. It's it's a fun song. It is. That and

**SPEAKER_1** [00:49:08]

Farmer Refuted,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:49:09]

both very fun songs. Far so Farmer Refuted is fantastic.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:49:13]

My kids don't care for it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:49:15]

I I think here's what I've noticed.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:49:17]

You and missus Lemon like Farmer Refuted more than anybody else I know because it's a that is a musician's song.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:49:23]

Right? Even when you think about lines like, please don't modulate the key. Okay. Yeah. Like,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:49:29]

all of that is appealing.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:49:30]

All of that is appealing to you folks that know how to do

**SPEAKER_1** [00:49:35]

Well, maybe missus Lemon and I should record a duet. There you go. That'd be fantastic. Release it on the podcast and break all sorts of copyright problems. Oh, yeah. We'd all go to jail.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:49:47]

Yeah. I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:49:49]

I think they I would guess they would enjoy it. I I don't know. I don't know how much

**SPEAKER_1** [00:49:54]

how much So, like theater they want. I think my parents or my mom at least would be very turned off by the style of music and

**SPEAKER_1** [00:50:03]

the p g 13 words and things like that.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:50:06]

But I think that if she was able to make it past those things, I think she'd really enjoy it as an art form and a story.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:50:15]

I I don't know that my dad would care for the style of music. I think that would be

**SPEAKER_0** [00:50:21]

a hurdle for him.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:50:23]

But I know he I know he dig the the history element of it. I actually saw it with my mom, so I know what she thinks, and she enjoyed it.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:50:31]

But So I think my my dad will enjoy it just because we talked about it, and he loves movies. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:50:38]

Well, it's it's long. Right? Like, this is it's Yeah. It's the There's an intermission, though. It is. That was hilarious.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:50:47]

I I think

**SPEAKER_0** [00:50:49]

if you don't like theater,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:50:51]

if you don't like hip hop and rap,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:50:53]

if you don't like history,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:50:55]

which

**SPEAKER_0** [00:50:56]

mean, I I think I've I've classified

**SPEAKER_1** [00:50:59]

at least theaters your weakest in laws.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:02]

Two out of three. Well, I I was about to say

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:06]

I I kind of for at least 48% of the people that voted in the last election. No.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:10]

Oh.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:11]

Too far. Too far. No. I I think even if you don't like those things,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:15]

this is worth watching

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:17]

because it's it's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:18]

it's been a huge cultural

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:21]

thing

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:22]

since it came out. You know? Like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:25]

for Pete's sake, the the $10

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:28]

bill

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:29]

was on the way out. They were gonna scuttle it, and the reason that Treasury kept that around is because of this musical. You know? The impact of this thing is huge,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:39]

and I I think I think it's worth being familiar with it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:43]

And if you don't have the patience to sit and listen to the soundtrack all the way through, which is what you should do. If you wanna if you wanna learn this musical,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:51:51]

you should listen to it start to finish. If you're not gonna do that, watch it. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:51:56]

Definitely watch it. I I would say that

**SPEAKER_1** [00:51:59]

it was probably the fourth time listening through the musical that I actually understood what was going on.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:52:05]

Like, I remember

**SPEAKER_1** [00:52:06]

feeling emotion

**SPEAKER_1** [00:52:08]

when

**SPEAKER_1** [00:52:12]

we just said his name. Philip. Hamilton's son. Philip. Yep. When Philip died and, like, the next four songs after that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:52:21]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:52:22]

Well, it is it is so packed with information.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:52:25]

I mean, I, like, I I don't think we can properly

**SPEAKER_0** [00:52:30]

communicate

**SPEAKER_0** [00:52:30]

how much is packed into these songs

**SPEAKER_0** [00:52:34]

unless you read them. And that that's what Hamilton's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:52:38]

whole life. Yeah. Literally.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:52:40]

It it is actually reading the words that got missus Lemon engrossed into this because Lin Manuel Miranda put together a book of all the words to the play

**SPEAKER_0** [00:52:51]

or the musical rather,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:52:52]

and with

**SPEAKER_0** [00:52:54]

notes in the columns about, like, how the song came to be, why they say the things they say, etcetera. She bought it from the library, and she got just completely absorbed because it's a fantastic story.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:53:06]

So, yeah, you gotta you gotta give yourself a chance. I think the I think seeing it will help with that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:53:14]

It's I just think it's worth seeing. I think everybody should watch it at least once. Even if you don't like rap, hip hop, or the theater,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:53:23]

give it a shot.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:53:24]

Don't throw away your shot.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:53:27]

I am not throwing away my

**SPEAKER_1** [00:53:31]

Alright, Stan. We have other movies to talk about on this list here, but we're going on an hour. So I say we punt until next week and add a couple more movies to the list probably.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:53:40]

I'm I'm fine with that. I wanna just do a quick teaser though, if I can.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:53:45]

Alright. If you have not so this this movie just came out to HBO Max. A bunch of people have HBO Max. If you have not seen the movie Midway,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:53:54]

**SPEAKER_0** [00:53:56]
