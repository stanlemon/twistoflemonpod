Dear Listener,

This week Stan wanted to record early so he wouldn't miss the presidential debate.

We have an update on lawn care in Indianapolis and in Cedar Rapids. Stan has gone app crazy with the app library function. And he bought new shoes, it didn't take 3 months this time.

The main event in this episode is the Meat Rubs by Fenker hamburger seasoning taste test. Both Stan and Jon tried 3 different burger seasonings. Listen in for their reactions and which one we hope that Fenker mass produces.

Thanks for listening! If you like what you hear, please share with a friend.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier

P.S. [Check out Stan's YouTube video from his tasting.](https://youtu.be/aJZFLXLgzTA)
