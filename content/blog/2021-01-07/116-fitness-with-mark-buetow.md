Dear Listener,

Today we are joined by Jon's father in law, because Jon didn't do enough research to talk about Fitness+ enough for Stan's liking.

Rev. Mark Buetow is a board-gaming extraordinaire and pastor of Zion Lutheran Church in McHenry, IL. He has previously used Beach Body and has been using Fitness+ regularly since its launch.

We talk about initial reactions and how Fitness+ shows off the best, the worst, and the emerging aspects of Apple.

Thanks for listening if you like what you hear, please share with a friend!

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
