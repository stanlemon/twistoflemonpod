Dear Listener,

We lost the first thirteen minutes of this week's episode due to Jon's internet going down, so we had to do a take two. This led into a discussion of all things Narnia and Lord of The Rings.

From there we touch on episode 6 of WandaVision, the M1 MacBook Air and coming up on a year of the pandemic.Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
