Dear Listener,

Good news! Stan isn't as worried about going to jain for tax fraud anymore. Stan gives an update on the M1 MacBook Air.

The snow is gone in Indianapolis and melting in Cedar Rapids, so we start talking about lawn care. Jon takes a look at Stan's soil test and breaks down what he should be doing to start off the season.

We also answer a question from Patrick Sturdivant on brown spots in his St. Augustine lawn.

Stan dives into how he uses a work phone vs a personal cell phone.

And we review last week's episode of WandaVision.

Thanks for Listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
