Dear Listener,

We have been covering Falcon and the Winter Soldier post credits for the last couple of weeks. After this last episode Stan decided we need to discuss it in the main portion of the podcast. (Mostly because he isn't sure Jon will keep on watching.)

Listen in as we talk about the good the bad and the ugly of Disney+ Falcon and the Winter Soldier up to this point.

Thanks for listening! Let us know if you have anything that you'd like us to talk about on the podcast.

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
