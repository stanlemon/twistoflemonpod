Dear Listener,

In this episode, we talk about a bunch of stuff we didn't have on the list of things to talk about. To kick it off, Stan wants to know how you eat a taco.

From there we talk about the season finale of Ted Lasso Season 2 and what we expect from future seasons from our offices that are both in disarray.

Finally, Jon calls out Stan for having Air Pods Max over his ears and not saying anything about them.

Listen in, if you like what you hear leave a review and let a friend know about Life with a Twist of Lemon

Thanks,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
