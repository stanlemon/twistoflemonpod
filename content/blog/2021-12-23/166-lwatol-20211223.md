**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:00]

Dramas, please.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:13]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:20]

This is life

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:22]

with a twist of lemon.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:24]

Alright, John. I'm coming to you live from my wife's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:28]

closet.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:29]

How how goes it in your world?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:32]

I am still in my office with my orange wall.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:36]

The lighting is better in the closet than it is in your office though.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:40]

I It's a smaller space. It doesn't take as many lumens to to fill it up, I guess.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:45]

Got it. So so dear listener, the reason I am in the closet is because I have ripped the carpet out of my office.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:52]

What? John's shaking his head.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:00:56]

Nothing. Continue.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:00:57]

Okay. I I ripped the carpet out of my office in order to remove the marks of taliesin.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:04]

I'm putting down laminate but it is Which is going false. The dog number one in the office.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:10]

Missus Lemon begs to disagree but whatever. Whatever.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:13]

Who's who's keeping score? Anyhow,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:16]

nonetheless, here we are. I am in the closet recording because this is the only place I could think of that would kill sound.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:23]

There are lots of clothes here, most of which are not mine,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:27]

to kill sound. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:30]

sound okay, John?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:32]

So far, so good. Okay. So this is our Christmas episode. Right?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:36]

This is our Christmas episode. It will release on the twenty third.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:40]

Alright. Well, I can't imagine anybody's gonna listen to this episode. Like, this seems like the least likely to be listened to episode that we record each year.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:49]

Maybe.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:50]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:01:51]

Thanksgiving might be worse because that, like, falls on Thanksgiving.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:01:55]

Yeah. But, like, people drive to go visit their family, and so maybe we get a little bit of car action. I'm not sure.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:02]

But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:03]

anyhow, what, what are you doing for Christmas, John?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:07]

I am headed to Milwaukee.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:09]

Alright. And what, what is in Milwaukee? What brings you to Milwaukee this time of year?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:15]

My parents.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:16]

I have a brother and sister still in Milwaukee.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:19]

My grandmother is still is living with my parents. So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:24]

yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:25]

Are you taking the dog with you?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:27]

We are. Okay. So the dog gets to mark

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:31]

his territory in your folks' house next.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:33]

The dog has, like, grown a lot since he came to visit your house. Oh, yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:38]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:40]

what, what all do you do while you're visiting family?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:45]

So it seems like this will probably be church and eating.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:02:50]

And do you do the Christmas ham? Or what what's what's

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:54]

I don't know how we're doing any

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:56]

big dinner sort of thing.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:02:58]

Like, traditionally,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:01]

Christmas Eve was always at my grandma's house. She sold her house this year and moved in with my parents,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:09]

and that was always everything ham, turkey,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:12]

the whole spread, Swedish meatballs.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:15]

Okay. But it was turkey, not ham?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:18]

Both.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:19]

Oh, both.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:20]

Wow. Both. That's a lot of meat.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:24]

Well,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:25]

my mom's has family as a family of five,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:29]

and the majority of them had kids. So Okay. Well, alright. So do you when you cook a ham, do you put pineapple on it?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:37]

No.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:38]

Interesting. My dad always did that, and I I guess it's there's some, like, connection to the way folks in Michigan do ham or something. I don't know. I mean, it sounds interesting,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:03:50]

but I don't wanna kill my wife.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:52]

Oh, is she allergic to pineapple?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:03:54]

She's allergic to pineapple. Holy cats. Alright. Well, that's an very important detail to know when ordering

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:01]

missus Kolmeier drinks.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:03]

Alright. I gotta keep that in mind. Thank you very much.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:07]

Speaking of drinks, John, what do you got there?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:10]

I have

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:11]

pink gin but I want a little heavy on the bitter so it's more amber than pink.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:17]

So Okay. So gin and bitters,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:19]

is that it?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:21]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:22]

Okay. I ran out of a The drink have a name?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:26]

Pink gin.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:27]

Oh, that's that's literally let's okay. The name. When you when you said pink gin, I thought that that might refer to a particular type of gin. This just shows how little I know about, you know, drinks. Indeed. I think you might like this gin. It's not too juniper y.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:41]

What, what what kind of gin is it?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:04:43]

I honestly don't remember. I'd have to go look at the bottle, but mister Martin came back with it for me.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:50]

Wait. Is it from Aldi?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:04:52]

No. Hy Vee. Oh, okay. Well, I would love to know the name of it. I'd be curious. I am sitting here with the Sierra Nevada.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:00]

I guess this is just their torpedo. It's their their pale ale, so nothing too exciting. But for some reason And actually, I think I know why, but for some reason,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:08]

this particular pale ale I associate with Christmas time.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:13]

Interesting.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:14]

Yeah. So guess it's not because it's green either. The bottle the bottle's green, the label.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:20]

K.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:21]

My father-in-law had some, like, actual Christmas beer

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:25]

that was, like, spiced.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:28]

And The name of it sounded like there's no way this can be good, but then I had it and

**SPEAKER_1** [00:05:33]

it was tasty.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:34]

So Sun King put out something called the electric reindeer and it involves ginger

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:40]

and molasses

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:41]

and it tastes like Christmas. I'm not sure that it's a good beer, but I think it's probably a good Christmas beer, if that makes sense.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:49]

Sure. I would say, in general, I am not a fan of most Christmas beers, just like I'm not a fan of most, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:05:57]

Halloween themed beers. Right? Like, the pumpkin spice typically

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:00]

ruins a beer, I think that the way that, you can spice a beer for Christmas,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:06]

it can also do a lot of damage. So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:09]

Yep. So the gin is

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:12]

Bootle's gin, b o o d l e s. Bootle's. Okay. I'll have to look that up. Never heard of it. It sounds like cry. The first time you've ever had it too.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:22]

It is. Okay. I wanna try something new.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:27]

Alright. So, this is the our our Christmas

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:31]

I guess, our the eve of Christmas Eve

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:33]

episode,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:34]

and

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:36]

we are going to talk about a a topic that Dan says proposed.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:41]

Before we do that, I just wanna wish everyone a Yeah. Merry

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:44]

In case you in case you duck out because of what we're about to discuss,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:06:48]

I just wanna wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. It's been great knowing you or having you listen to us.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:55]

You know what I am gonna do for Christmas?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:06:58]

What? So I have some Brandy Alexander supplies, so I'll probably mix up Brandy Alexander's for anyone who wants one on Christmas Eve. What goes into Brandy Alexander?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:06]

Brandy,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:07]

creme de coco,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:09]

cream, or half and half.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:13]

Is that it? That might be it. Wait. Okay. Creme de coco. Oh, nutmeg. Nutmeg,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:18]

Okay. Is garnish.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:19]

Creme

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:20]

de coco. What like, what is that? Is that just like hot chocolate mix?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:25]

No. It's a liquor. A liquor. Oh, okay. So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:29]

just a mixing thing, but you'll find it in your mixing section.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:34]

Can can I get away with just hot cocoa mix? Like, because I've got brandy, and I've got

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:40]

heavy whipping cream.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:42]

So this is more a cold drink,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:45]

and I can put it you're gonna make the

**SPEAKER_1** [00:07:48]

I I guess you can try it. Like, the whole thing is it it's kind of like a brandied milkshake.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:53]

Okay. Alright. So I could definitely get behind that.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:57]

I I bought the brandy a few years ago for

**SPEAKER_0** [00:07:59]

eggnog, spiked eggnog,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:01]

and I have not used it since, so it's been sitting in my my cabinet for a couple years now.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:07]

So when my uncle made these a couple years ago at Christmas, he just used vanilla ice cream and put it in a blender to blend it all up. Now, see, that that I could get behind.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:18]

See? A brand It's brandy float.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:21]

Okay. Alright. So you wanna set up this topic from Dan Chess? Because you were you were the one out soliciting.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:26]

You were the one

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:29]

I I guess,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:30]

I you you wanted to engage on this, so set it up.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:34]

I wanted to engage on this. I just put it on the list because it was suggested, and I'll do anything to make our listener happy.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:40]

Our listener. We we've gone to the singular.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:43]

Those of you that are listening that are not Dan Chess, I'm sorry.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:08:47]

We love you, or I do at least.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:51]

Basically,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:52]

I don't know. Danchez was complaining about how expensive Five Guys has gotten, which I completely agree with.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:57]

And

**SPEAKER_1** [00:08:59]

just out of the blue, he says, so topic,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:01]

top 10 songs.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:03]

Subjectively, of course,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:05]

your top 10

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:06]

top 10 he says, you top 10 songs to you. I think he means, like, your personal top 10 songs as in you're going to die and you have to listen to 10 songs before you die.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:16]

I thought this is something about being on an island all by ourselves.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:22]

An island?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:24]

Yeah. I thought he I thought he said, like, if you had only 10 songs to play on repeat on an island Wasn't that part of what he set up? Oh, alright. Well I was not part of that conversation. I don't know who he who you had. I I swear Were you talking to Sarah about it? No. Oh, no. No. No. Alright. And and just just so we can take a quick pause here.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:41]

The going rate for a hamburger at Five Guys is $7.59,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:45]

at least in Indianapolis.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:47]

Is that is that a lot for a hamburger?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:09:51]

I would say no, but I don't I think that ours are way more expensive now.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:09:56]

Really? Well, I don't know what's going on in Iowa. Alright. So your top 10 songs. Do you wanna do this from 10 or from one? One being the best. Like, where do you wanna start?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:06]

Actually, I I'm not even sure if this more Okay.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:09]

Yeah. Let's not So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:11]

I I made a playlist on Apple Music. So I was at top of the playlist. Okay. Alright. Let's So this is the order that I thought of them, I guess. You're more organized than I am. Go for it, John.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:23]

Number one, fly me to the moon,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:26]

Frank Sinatra.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:28]

Oh, look at you going old and classic.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:31]

Also,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:10:32]

the first dance song at my wedding.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:36]

Is it really?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:37]

Yes.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:38]

Did anybody know

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:41]

like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:42]

did anybody

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:43]

David make any connection with that at the wedding? Because I don't know. I honestly, like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:48]

I really thought your, your DJ was, like, whack. So Awful. Yeah. Yeah. He was he was pretty bad. I think he yelled at him once for me.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:10:56]

At at least once. I was unhappy because I had a lot of songs I wanted to listen and dance to. Okay. Alright. So so that's that's a that's an interesting choice.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:05]

Why? But, John, what's what's the reason there?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:09]

I don't know. I like to sing it and

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:11]

again, first dance song at my wedding. Do you wanna do you wanna sing it here?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:16]

Fly me to the moon.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:19]

Let me play

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:21]

among the stars.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:22]

I should take one ear off my headphone because I'm probably really tone

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:26]

off. So It's it's it's alright, John. We're you can't sing anymore because we'd be in copyright violation. So. Right. That was fair use. Alright. What's what's the next one?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:35]

Concerning hobbits.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:38]

I is this is this from the soundtrack? Is this like a a instrumental? Yes. This is Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:11:46]

I don't know. Okay. You want me to put it on the recorder?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:49]

Oh, is that the one that you did when we did the reading from The Hobbit?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:11:54]

Yes. Yes. It is. Oh, okay. Okay. Alright. Alright. See, you should just you should with that. Alright. Next up, this is these are all very interesting choices so far. It just gets more interesting as we go down, Stan. Okay. Brandenburg Concerto number three by Johann Sebastian Bach.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:11]

Alright. So far, you're, like, mostly gravitating towards tasteful music.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:16]

I can't say the same for myself.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:19]

Do you wanna give us your top three next? My my top three well, when when because Dan asked us

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:26]

So I was trying to think.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:28]

When Dan just asked us, I actually led with a few Christmas songs, but I I think I think I wanna be more precise than what

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:37]

than what I I told him. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:40]

I I This You're gonna die. You're gonna die. The first one that comes to mind,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:45]

Santa Baby by Ariana Grande.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:12:48]

I don't know that I've ever heard that version.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:52]

Really? Oh my goodness. It's so good. It's so good. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:56]

I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:12:58]

am also a real big fan

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:01]

of

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:03]

the the twelve Days of Christmas Done by Straight No Chaser,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:06]

which ends with Africa.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:09]

Okay? Yep. And it's just it's just fun and ridiculous.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:13]

And then I was trying to think of

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:15]

because because so the first three that I gave, right, they were all

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:19]

Christmas songs.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:21]

And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:22]

I absolutely

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:23]

love

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:24]

Trace Adkins, The King's Gift album when it comes to Christmas music.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:29]

And so I was trying to think, like, what what is my favorite song from that album? And it is the most theologically inaccurate

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:36]

song on on the album, right, which is We Three Kings.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:39]

So it's like, it's it's totally totally wrong. The only one that maybe comes close to it is I Saw Three Ships, which I am

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:46]

I also love,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:47]

but is absurd. But that's not the one I'm choosing. I'm choosing We Three Kings because I've got a soft spot for the absurdity of that that song, that carol.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:13:56]

Is called if you die in July.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:13:59]

Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Abs I picked these three like like, look, I if you remember,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:04]

I started listening to Christmas music after Halloween.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:07]

Right? Yes. I'm I'm that guy.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:10]

And you can judge me all you want, John Colmire,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:13]

but I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:14]

like I like Christmas music. Now, I I admit to not getting into the Christmas spirit as much as past years. I think I have hypotheses on why this is. There are no Christmas lights up on my house. Sorry.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:25]

Though your kids said something?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:27]

Yeah. We've we've been busy, man. We've been distracted. At this point, like, I'm a put them up for a week before the homeowners association starts griping about it, so it's, like, not even worth it, you know?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:37]

So I don't know. I believe me, I got thoughts on this front. Nonetheless Hey. This could be like, you could have a religious exemption

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:45]

because,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:47]

what comes after Christmas? Epiphany.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:14:49]

An epiphany is what? The Gentiles Christmas, and you're a Gentile. Yeah. There you go. There you go. Alright.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:56]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:58]

Somehow,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:14:58]

I don't think I don't think that'll apply. Alright, John. Don't you have a friend on the complaint board?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:04]

No. No. No. No. No. No. I I don't know anybody on the complaint board. It was a bunch of friends that contemplated

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:10]

running for the complaint board because we felt like we could do, you know, the processing

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:15]

of complaints properly.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:15:21]

Circular file?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:22]

You got it, buddy. Alright. Let's keep going.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:15:26]

So was that two or three for me?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:28]

I I did three because it yeah. So Santa Baby

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:33]

oh my goodness. What did I say for the second one? We Three Kings. What was the other one?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:38]

I I only know of two. I gave you three. Let's just keep going. Oh, it was it was Pentatonix.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:43]

Oh, no. No. Not Pentatonix. Straight No Chases. Straight No Chases. That one counts. Okay. Yeah. Got it. Yep. K.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:15:49]

So number four, Six Cycle Carousel by Lifehouse.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:53]

Like, what?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:55]

You're such a child of the nineties.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:15:58]

I guess it's early odds, actually.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:16:00]

Hey. I mean, we're we're getting closer. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:03]

I I don't even know this song by Lifehouse. I feel like I know maybe one song by Lifehouse in total. I'll send it to you.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:10]

Okay. Well, I I probably want your whole playlist after this. Okay. So,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:16]

gosh, I don't I can't say the one that I was gonna do next.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:22]

Let me think about this, John.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:25]

Some of the music I listen to

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:27]

is is just pretty awful.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:30]

I would say When When We Ride by Tupac featuring the Outlaw Immortals.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:35]

Okay? Do you are you familiar with this song at all? I'm sure you've played it in your car while I've been in there. Probably. So this is this is from the album All Eyes On Me, and it feeds so his crew was the Outlaw Immortals,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:48]

and this is, like, I think one of the best showcases of all their talents

**SPEAKER_0** [00:16:53]

aside from maybe Hit them Up, which I I'm not even gonna tell anybody to listen to because it's such a foul song. But this I just enjoy this one, and it always kinda gets me gets me pumped up. So that would be my number four.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:06]

Number five,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:07]

The Story of Tonight from Hamilton.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:10]

Oh, that's a good one. I actually

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:13]

oh, can I make that my number five too?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:16]

Sure.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:17]

Okay. I'm gonna I'm gonna go

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:19]

actually, now you're now you're making me think. Wait. What I so The Story of Tonight is definitely one

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:24]

of my favorites from the album. The question Do like it more than helpless? That's that's what I was telling you aside.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:31]

Right? Do I like it more than helpless? And I'm not

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:34]

sure. The other one that I really like that really, like, puts me over the nines is Yorktown. So if I had to pick if I had to pick a Hamilton song, it would be between Helpless, Yorktown,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:46]

and The Story of Tonight. Oh, but then there's Washington's Farewell.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:49]

Oh.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:52]

Teach them how to say goodbye. That would be great for,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:17:55]

you're gonna die top 10 song playlist.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:17:58]

Gosh. Can you imagine? That's you know what that is? That right there should be how every prom ends.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:04]

Teach me how to say goodbye. Yeah. No. Okay. Alright. I would have to choose helpless. That'll be that'll be my number five.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:18:12]

Number six, carry on my wayward son, Kansas.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:16]

I I do not know this. I do not know this before. You need a Kansas guitar hero. Okay. Old

**SPEAKER_1** [00:18:22]

rock band. Okay. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:25]

I I would

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:27]

most likely choose Will two k.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:30]

From the Will Ending Interesting.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:18:33]

So is that

**SPEAKER_1** [00:18:34]

your one Will Smith song or are there more coming?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:37]

No. That's that's the one that I would choose. So I was I was trying to think about So so here's the thing. Right? My love for Will Smith,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:44]

I've got a lot of Fresh Prince that I love. Right? So summertime is is definitely

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:49]

in contention here.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:51]

However Which is how we kick off the podcast. It is. Yeah. It's a great jam. But if I We

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:57]

do. Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:18:59]

Alright. Maybe you're talking me out of Will two k and into summertime. But the but the thing is

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:03]

Yeah. Actually, you know, as bizarre

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:06]

as the Will Smith biography was, the story around summertime

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:10]

is is really kinda funny because apparently, he was sick, is why his voice is in such a lower tone when they recorded it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:16]

Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:17]

Because it it I mean, if you like if you listen to, you know, some of the classics like Parents Just Don't Understand or Nightmare on My Street, like, those, his voice is high and like, nasally

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:27]

and that was by design.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:28]

And I I guess they had the lyrics to this song. I guess maybe they had the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:34]

hook for it and he wrote the lyrics

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:37]

before leaving a recording session in Chicago

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:39]

and then had to record it.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:42]

Thus, it came out sounding very different for Will Smith. But anyhow, when when I think about

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:48]

my love for Will Smith and his music, right, there's there's Big Willie style,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:54]

which is a it's just a fantastic album.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:19:57]

But if I am if I'm like just left to my druthers here, I'm gonna grab Bullenium. I love that album as a whole more than Big Willie style.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:08]

And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:09]

for me, that Will two k song,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:12]

I I have probably not played any other song more in my life than that one song.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:18]

K? And I blew a pair of speakers

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:21]

on 12/31/1999

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:24]

playing that jam, and I have no regrets. So that's why that's on my list.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:29]

Nice.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:30]

Alright. That's number 6. Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:32]

That was 6. 6 or 7. Wait. Wait. Hold on. Is it 6? +1, 23456.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:37]

Okay. 7.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:39]

The longest time Billy Joel.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:42]

That's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:43]

that's a good choice. Billy Joel did not make my cut, but maybe he should have. I don't know.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:50]

That's a It was tough to pick a Billy Joel song. So there's like piano man there.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:20:54]

There's Uptown Girl, Scenes From an Italian Restaurant,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:20:58]

so but the longest time is what made the list. Lots of good ones. Alright. So I would have to go to the Coasts of Carolina by Jimmy Buffett. Now, this is not a song that most people think of when they think of Jimmy Buffett,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:10]

but

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:11]

it comes from the

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:14]

Gosh. The License to Chill album,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:16]

which is an album he does with a whole bunch bunch of guest instrumentalists

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:20]

from the country genre.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:22]

And it's it's just a it's just a fun album, but Coast of Carolina,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:26]

to me, it's like the ultimate kickback and just, you know,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:30]

sip some rose or

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:33]

a watered down beer and enjoy the sun in the sand.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:39]

Fair enough. I got one of those coming up. That's number 10 for me, though. Alright. Well, what's so that was

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:45]

That was seven. Or eight. Okay. What's your number eight?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:48]

Eight, mister Bright Side featuring Blake Lewis by Scott Bradley's postmodern jukebox.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:53]

Oh,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:54]

that's a really good rendition

**SPEAKER_0** [00:21:56]

of that little Yeah.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:21:58]

One of those covers that's better than the original. Kind of Yeah. Like Johnny Cash is hurt, but that did not make my list. Actually, no, Johnny Cash made the list, so

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:07]

Okay. So for my next one, I really struggled with this. I was trying to think of what Zach Brown band song I would pick.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:15]

Do you Does Zach Brown make your cut at all?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:18]

He does. Okay.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:22:21]

Is it, like, is it next? Like, if if I say my Zach Brown band, are you gonna say yours? No. So he's at the bottom of the list. But, again, I just as it came to mind and so

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:31]

So I picked Martin,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:33]

which is named after the guitar. Right? Right. And it is such a, like, poetic song

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:39]

that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:41]

I just I just love it. Right? So that that one, I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:45]

When I was making this list, I knew there was gonna be some Zach Brown.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:48]

I didn't exactly

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:50]

know which one,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:22:53]

and then I got to thinking about it and and all I could come up with was Martin. I was like, that's the song. If I had to pick a Zach Brown band song to be stuck with,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:01]

that was it.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:03]

Alright.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:05]

Number nine,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:07]

punk rock prince princess something corporate.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:10]

Oh, interesting.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:11]

Okay. So that has good

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:13]

high school ties for me,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:16]

plus

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:17]

Andrew McMahon was the greatest concert that I've ever attended

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:21]

in life. Okay. So Alright.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:24]

What what do we have? Is this next one eight for me?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:27]

No. It'll be nine next.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:29]

Nine next.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:31]

Oh, my So you're down to two, Stan.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:33]

Okay.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:35]

So the next one, this is this is, you're gonna you're gonna laugh. Have you ever heard the It's it's a a CCM song, In Christ Alone?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:23:43]

Yes.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:44]

Okay. Alright. I This I enjoy this song, but the Newsboys rendition of it is my absolute favorite. And

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:53]

I I just I I love it. So it's it's one that

**SPEAKER_0** [00:23:57]

makes me feel good, but I also belt out. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:00]

there you go, John. Alright. Fair enough. Did you see did you see that coming?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:05]

I figured that it would be the insiders,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:08]

but okay. Well, we got one more, John.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:12]

Number 10,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:13]

chicken fried, Zach Brown band, because I think of this as the quintessential

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:18]

Zach Brown song.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:21]

Chicken fried is good.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:24]

I don't so here here's the thing. I don't think that chicken fried is the best demonstration

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:29]

of why people like

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:30]

Zach Brown.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:32]

Right? Like, it's it's catchy.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:34]

So it's between this and Highway 20 Ride.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:24:37]

Don't know what the name of that song is. What's the name of Highway 20.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:41]

That So that was my number two. That was my my b pick

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:45]

for

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:48]

my Zach Brown slot. Right? So it was Martin or Highway 20. Sweet Annie is also a really good one. Yep. And I I think you look at those three, the the instrumental aspects of it are

**SPEAKER_0** [00:24:58]

just really great. Right? The more fiddle, the better.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:03]

The the poetry of all three of those songs is far superior to chicken fried. Chicken fried's a lot of fun. Don't get me wrong. Yes. But And I don't have a lot of fun songs on here, Stan. No. No. You definitely don't. You definitely don't. Alright. So I, you called it out. Right? Like, insiders. That's kind of my ska punk band that I always gravitate towards. Do you still own that domain?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:23]

No, I don't. I don't. Man. I let that one expire. So here's here's the thing.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:28]

There were there was a whole bunch of insiders music that I listened to as a kid that I loved. Right? And then in college, they released this album called Soundtrack to a Revolution

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:39]

and I played it to the point of death. Like, I I I played it so much.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:46]

And and there was There were two songs. Actually,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:50]

yeah. Probably two songs that, like, I I had on on loop. One was Call of Arms, the other was Testimony. Testimony is the one that probably stands out the most to me.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:58]

However

**SPEAKER_0** [00:25:59]

however,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:01]

a few years back, they released a album called Soundtrack to a Revolution. And I never listened to it when it came out because I was like disconnected from that world, not paying attention.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:10]

And over the summer, I picked it up and I've I've worn that sucker out, if you get what I'm saying. Right? And there's a song on there,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:18]

called the Sinner Songbook that features,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:21]

Reese Roper from Five Iron Frenzy and also this guy from the Orange County Supertones.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:26]

And I absolutely love that jam. So that would be my final pick. Now, I'm sure these last two annoyed Dan Chaz because I I I just got this suspicion he's not a big CCM guy, and that's fine. He's camp director, man. We He'll still campfire.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:41]

I'm sure he knows in Christ alone. I we all have our vices. These are mine. So there you go.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:46]

Some of them.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:49]

So, yeah. Top 10 songs.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:51]

Yeah. What were

**SPEAKER_0** [00:26:53]

so thinking beyond the top 10, what were the close cuts for you?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:26:58]

So, like, I didn't think that far ahead. I literally threw this list together before we hit record.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:04]

But as I'm looking at it now, I'm definitely missing some

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:08]

Ska on

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:10]

here. Maybe spider webs by no doubt.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:13]

Oh.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:14]

Oh. No doubt. That's just that's just good clean fun.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:18]

And then, like, I feel

**SPEAKER_1** [00:27:21]

like we need Summer Girls by LFO on these lists.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:25]

It's too easy, isn't it? So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:27]

I listen to a lot of Alan Jackson. He did not make the cut. I am in particular

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:32]

a fan of,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:34]

like like Red on a Rose. Right? So Firefly Song,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:38]

is just a a great jam. Five Iron Frenzy also did not make my cut. And I would probably gravitate towards either, oh,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:46]

I don't know, maybe Ugly Day or Far Sight or no, excuse me, Far Far Away are are ones that I really like.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:54]

There's also

**SPEAKER_0** [00:27:56]

no Trace Adkins. I like a lot of Trace Adkins. I'm not even sure what I would pick on that front. Maybe Honky Tonk Badonkadonk because it's just a good fun jam. And it's also

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:05]

the the song that my wedding party danced to.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:08]

And then,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:10]

gosh, what is it? Willie Nelson and Toby Keith, Beer for My Horses

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:15]

was my introduction to country music. My second introduction, I should say, because it was actually Alan Jackson, Mercury Blues,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:21]

from an episode of Home Improvement. But whatever. I I digress.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:25]

So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:29]

that that's not Mercury Blues. If I had if I had money, I'll tell you what I do. I buy a Yeah. No. Mercury Blues. That's right song. Alright. Gosh. I'm all over the place. Here's the other one that would make a John, and this I bet you didn't see coming. Elton John made in England.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:28:43]

Interesting.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:28:44]

Yeah. Yeah. Probably not the one that I would've gone with from Elton John either. Well, there's a lot of good Elton John music to draw from, this this particular album that Made in England actually, it might be called Made in England, the album. Also had the song Believe on it, and it came out when

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:00]

During the year that I first started watching

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:03]

MTV's

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:04]

Total Request Live.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:06]

And so,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:07]

the video

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:09]

for Believe, I think,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:11]

was It was either Believe or I or was made in England, came out

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:15]

Christmas. And so,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:16]

you know, I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:18]

Everybody's got Spotify, Apple Music, and whatever these days. Right? But back in the day, we used to have to go out and buy a whole album and then we'd listen to that thing until we wore it out or Or better,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:30]

if it was a radio single,

**SPEAKER_1** [00:29:32]

you call in and request it, then wait for three hours and record it on your cassette tape. Exactly. Exactly. Or in my case, a mini disc player.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:40]

But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:41]

but nonetheless, that is what that is what we did. The audio quality was awful.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:46]

Right?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:47]

But

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:48]

we had that music. That's That was basically

**SPEAKER_0** [00:29:51]

our Apple Music back in the day. Now granted, there was this period of time where there was Napster and everything was off the rails, but we don't talk about that. Right? Because we all did lots of illegal things that we won't own up to anymore.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:04]

Right. So so interesting, I think, from both of our lists, we cross a variety of genres.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:30:10]

I think, honestly,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:13]

mine swings a little more than yours does. Yeah. Yours does. Yours is which is which is ironic because if I were a betting man, I bet I listen to more,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:22]

jazz and blues on a regular basis

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:25]

than you do.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:26]

I have a more music period than I do. Well, yeah. The the thing is I well, and and I also I like

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:33]

I I spent my first three songs on Christmas songs, but I love Christmas music. Right? You know how much time over the years I've spent curating my Christmas playlist.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:30:44]

And I also how much time just in the last two years. This year, you're spent a lot. So you must have perfected it last year. I I feel like last year, I came into my own with it. Right? Like,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:54]

I drove all the way to and from Chicago with just one playlist,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:57]

and there were dupe like, we played songs,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:30:59]

you know, multiple times. I got no regrets. I have I have no regrets.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:31:04]

You know what my favorite secular Christmas song is? What, John?

**SPEAKER_1** [00:31:08]

Christmas Valentine by Jason Mraz and Ingrid Michaelson.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:12]

Oh, that's on my playlist.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:13]

I know. I told you about it last year when it came out. It's it's that's it's a good little jam. I think Ingrid Michaelson,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:20]

I genuinely enjoy. Jason Mraz, I genuinely enjoy. I think the Out of the corpus of their music,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:26]

there's a lot of redundancy,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:27]

which is unfortunate.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:29]

But when they can do something like that Christmas single, it's it's it's just a lot of fun, you know? Yep.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:34]

I got a lot of Michael Buble on my Christmas playlist.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:31:38]

Nice.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:39]

No regrets there. I would actually say I was thinking about this the other day. Michael Buble,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:43]

Pentatonix,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:44]

Straight No Chaser,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:45]

and Tracy Adkins probably make up the vast majority of my Christmas playlist.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:50]

They're Like, you're gonna find all the things you you come to expect, whether it's the wrapping paper or Jingle Bell Rock or whatever. But those

**SPEAKER_0** [00:31:57]

four artists or or groups,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:00]

right, really make a big splash on my Christmas playlist. Think because they do a bunch of classics in a way that is distinct,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:09]

but also just really enjoyable.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:10]

So

**SPEAKER_1** [00:32:11]

Did you know that I got a Michael Buble tickets for Christmas in 2019?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:16]

I think I knew that actually. And you you were not able to go to that concert. Right? Because the concert was in March 2020. Yeah. So

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:23]

have you did those get refunded, or did you get, like I think I think my mom got them refunded. So Okay.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:32:30]

I don't know if he ever actually came to Milwaukee or not. But yeah. I I have heard that he has a really foul mouth in concert.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:32:38]

Probably true. Although, I wonder if that's still true, like, after everything he went through with the son and when he was gonna quit music and all that. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. It's a good question. I I would love to see him. So there I was thinking about this too.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:52]

People I would like to see in concert.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:54]

Barenaked Ladies, also didn't make my list oddly enough.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:32:58]

I would love to see Zach Brown Band in concert. I would I would Especially now that they're back to sounding good.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:04]

Yeah. Yeah. Well, although,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:06]

we haven't really talked about this ad nausea, but that latest album,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:10]

something felt wrong to me about it for a while,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:14]

and then Sarah started, like, hollering out what songs of their own they were ripping on. So basically, like, the instrumentation was the same as

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:23]

chicken fried, right, or or whatever.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:26]

And and so that Was that done purposeful? I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:29]

have no idea. That's actually a Seems great

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:31]

like something they would do purposefully.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:33]

Yeah. Yeah. Can see that. I can see that. Like, hey, you hated the last two albums.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:38]

Take this. Yeah. You know, I I yeah. You're probably right.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:41]

But so so, Braden Inkley's Zach Brown Band, I would love to see Michael Buble in concert.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:33:46]

I would actually honestly be open to seeing Billy Joel in concert. I think he would be I'd to see Billy Joel in concert. Yeah. I bet it'd be a ton of fun. So I am not a concert goer

**SPEAKER_1** [00:33:55]

No. I'm not even. In general. So but Billy Joel, I would fly to New York, which is a city I hate, and watch him live. So I think my last concert was Warped Tour nineteen ninety nine.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:07]

Wow.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:08]

Yeah. Yeah. So '99. I was young then.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:11]

I guess I guess I went mean, does it count if I went to a concert that was being thrown in a church on the Southeast

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:18]

Side or Southwest Side Of Chicago?

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:20]

Is that council Were they professional

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:22]

musicians? I mean, it was the insiders. So you decide. That's the specialist. Accounts.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:27]

They

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:28]

got paid. By their their own admission, they didn't get paid very much, though.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:34]

Jockey is the home of Summerfest, so I saw lots of random people at Summerfest,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:38]

so Oh, good deal. Alright.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:41]

Okay, friend. I think, that is about as much as they can belabor a top 10 or I guess I It's not really a top 10 songs. Right? It's it's like, we're gonna die Yeah.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:52]

I don't even know. It's

**SPEAKER_1** [00:34:54]

It was a poorly worded request.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:34:56]

It was. So you know, we we still love DHS.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:00]

Nonetheless,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:01]

I wish you a happy and Merry Christmas,

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:04]

and I

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:06]

look forward to talking to you after you've had some, hopefully, ham and turkey with with

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:12]

your extended family.

**SPEAKER_0** [00:35:13]

Alright, Stanley. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Until next time, John.

**SPEAKER_1** [00:35:18]

Later.
