Dear Listener,

This week we discuss Stan's frustration with Claude Code's sudden degradation, which sparks a conversation about trust in AI services.

Jon and Stan then dive into a Decoder interview with web inventor Tim Berners-Lee, exploring his surprisingly optimistic take on AI, personal data privacy, and the open web.

Lastly, we discuss community decline, Star Trek as the basis for all philosophy, and Apple's $229 knitted iPhone sock.

Thanks for listening and we'll talk to you soon,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
