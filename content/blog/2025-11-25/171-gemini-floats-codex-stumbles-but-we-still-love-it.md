Dear Listener,

This week we dive deep into the AI wars with Google's new Antigravity IDE hitting the scene. Stan walks through his experience testing this VS Code-based editor with built-in agent capabilities that can actually resize browser windows, detect UI issues, and iterate on fixes autonomously.

We compare the big three AI coding assistants - ChatGPT's Codex, Claude, and Gemini Code Assist - and discuss how each is positioning itself in the developer tools space. Jon shares a cautionary tale about Codex going completely off the rails with an overly complex canonical URL solution, reminding us all that you need to be skilled enough to validate AI-generated code.

In a move that shocked his entire family (his daughter thought it was a terminal illness announcement), Stan purchased his first Windows PC in years. We talk about the nostalgia of his first coding laptop with an AMD Athlon 4 processor, and his curiosity about Windows Subsystem for Linux and modern Windows development workflows.

Plus, we kick off the episode with an emergency strap wrench situation involving a jar of filthy cherries that nearly derailed Manhattan night.

Thanks for listening and we'll talk to you soon,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
