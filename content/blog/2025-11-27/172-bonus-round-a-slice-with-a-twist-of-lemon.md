Dear Listener,

In this special Thanksgiving bonus episode, we tackle the most important question of the holiday season: what makes Thanksgiving truly Thanksgiving?

Stan argues that pie - not turkey - is what defines the holiday. Nobody sits down and says "yum, turkey's my favorite," but pie? That's what we're all really here for.

We debate the merits of various pies (rhubarb reigns supreme for Stan, with pumpkin as a solid backup), discuss whether chocolate pie and cheesecake pie are actually pies or cakes in disguise, and take a firm stance on lattice tops versus crumble crusts. We also settle the age-old question: are McDonald's apple pockets actually pies? (Spoiler: they're delicious, but no.)

Jon learns that Stan has a deep freezer primarily dedicated to frozen rhubarb for pie-making purposes, and we both agree that calling things by their proper names matters - even if it doesn't change how delicious they are.

Happy Thanksgiving, and may your pie be plentiful.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
