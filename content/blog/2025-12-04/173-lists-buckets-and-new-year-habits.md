Dear Listener,

In this episode, we kick things off with a mystery: why did Jon unfriend Stan on Facebook? Turns out it was an inbox zero situation gone wrong, which leads us into Stan's philosophy on "lists vs buckets" - a productivity mindset shift from being a meticulous list-walker to becoming a free-flowing bucket person.

We recap our Thanksgiving experiences: deep-fried turkey vs smoked turkey, store-bought pie vs homemade rhubarb with lattice top (temped to perfection, of course), and the eternal debate over whether Cheesecake Factory cheesecake counts as a Thanksgiving dessert.

As we approach the new year, we dive deep into habits vs goals. Stan shares his habit-tracking journey from reading 15 minutes daily to his two-and-a-half year streak of morning Apple Fitness Plus workouts. Jon points out that Stan's self-discipline is "pretty rare" - though Stan insists he's not a fitness nut, just someone who doesn't want to die young.

Finally, we resurrect the wine tasting app project with help from Claude, just in time for the Wall Street Journal wine advent calendar. If you want to join us as a TestFlight user, reach out!

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
