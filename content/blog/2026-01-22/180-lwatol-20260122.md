Stan Lemon
Jonathan, it feels like it's been a minute since we've talked. You came back from Disneyland and then you've been largely quiet.

01:04.38
Jon
I suppose that's true. I've had things to do Last week was kind of busy. and But we did talk last week about the Disneyland trip.

01:11.74
Stan Lemon
We did talk about the Disneyland trip and then I didn't hear from you and days, days went on and on and on. And I wondered where in the world was Kohlmeier now? Did he return to Disneyland? And I don't know.

01:21.36
Jon
Oh, I wish.

01:22.78
Stan Lemon
yeah

01:23.66
Jon
I woke up to negative four degree weather here, Stan, today.

01:27.00
Stan Lemon
I was just gonna ask, what is what is the balmy temperature of ah Eastern ah Iowa? Negative four sounds awful.

01:34.74
Jon
as we are As we're recording, um we are at eight degrees on the positive side, which was the high today.

01:42.90
Stan Lemon
Eight was our low, 12 was our high. Wait, no, that's not right. 12 is not our high. 23 is our highest, 12 right now. So yeah, it's cold, John. This time of year always makes me wish I was somewhere other than Indiana.

01:56.76
Jon
You should make that happen.

01:58.62
Stan Lemon
Yeah, just I don't see that. I don't see that in my future right now, Jonathan. i need I need kids to move out first, I think. But, you know, it is what it So, okay. All right.

02:09.01
Stan Lemon
You've been back. Where have you been? like What have you been up to? why Why haven't I heard from you?

02:13.77
Jon
um I feel like you have heard from me, but our paths have not crossed. Like we FaceTimed you. Was that before we recorded maybe? Because I opened a bottle of wine and my daughter now um associates lots of things with you. But thanks to our wine advent calendar, it's like, oh, wine means we FaceTime Uncle Stan. so

02:34.36
Stan Lemon
I think that's a good association. i have some minor concerns, but in general, I'm very certain. Yeah, i yeah did you did I miss the FaceTime?

02:44.76
Stan Lemon
So you send me a voice you sent me a video, or your your wife sent me a video the other day of your daughter, um i guess on a play phone, saying Uncle Stan, which like, I was a TV remote, pretending to be a phone.

02:55.77
Jon
It was a TV remote. Yeah.

02:59.10
Stan Lemon
I love it. yeah

03:00.09
Jon
I don't

03:01.61
Stan Lemon
All right, what are you up to though?

03:05.03
Jon
know. I've had work. I've had church meetings taking over my life. And then, you know, cooking food, cleaning things up, getting resituated after traveling, staying inside.

03:18.97
Stan Lemon
That's a lot less exciting than I was expecting for someone who I haven't talked to in a week.

03:19.60
Jon
Yeah.

03:23.38
Jon
I mean, i I did text you a couple times. You were an overly talkative. What have you been up to, Stan?

03:27.86
Stan Lemon
The the the rate the rate of text messages.

03:29.08
Jon
This is a two-way street. ah

03:33.15
Stan Lemon
John's like, why are you interrogating me? um ah So I, you know, I think we're recording on on the Monday before this releases. I had the day off.

03:43.83
Stan Lemon
I actually had a I think, wildly productive day. i woke up insanely early. I was up at 545 today and I started reading. So today i

03:51.95
Jon
did text me a couple things, but you texted me like really long chunks of text that is very hard to read like while I'm working.

03:53.75
Stan Lemon
and

03:59.32
Stan Lemon
Yeah, so if I don't text you like um a Zoomer, you're not going to respond. That's what you're telling me. But John, I read a lot of stuff today.

04:05.24
Jon
Sure.

04:07.33
Stan Lemon
I like i feel like this is what retirement could look like if it if it is the way that I want to, the day that I had today. So I woke up and I was reading Julius Caesar. I've got the second book in the Silas series that I've been enjoying.

04:18.93
Stan Lemon
I've been reading some favorite Father Brown stories. And then I've been reading Dante's Inferno. So I touched all of those today, which was amazing.

04:25.01
Jon
Yeah.

04:28.60
Jon
Did you watch the Silo TV show?

04:28.76
Stan Lemon
i actually, I did, i did.

04:31.10
Jon
Is it the same thing?

04:32.82
Stan Lemon
ah So there's there's three books in this series. The two seasons of the show are based off of book one.

04:36.15
Jon
OK. OK.

04:40.44
Stan Lemon
It adds a lot of world building to book one. Book one is pretty fast paced, not much of a world building book. um I loved the show, which is why I decided to read the book.

04:51.70
Jon
I remember you recommending the show to me, which I have not watched yet.

04:56.28
Stan Lemon
Yeah, it's i mean I genuinely enjoyed it.

04:56.28
Jon
But there are several of those. so

04:59.51
Stan Lemon
So I jumped in. Book two is wildly different. Different ah setting, different time. it's ah It's all very dystopian. So if you're not in just dystopian books, like don't don't read this.

05:12.05
Stan Lemon
But I'm enjoying it so far.

05:12.53
Jon
Mm-mm.

05:14.71
Stan Lemon
But I did that today. i had Pilates class. um I baked bread. I've been doing pretty good with that as as one of my New Year's resolutions. It's just been ah it's been a chill day. And I had, you know, so the reason i'm reading Dante's Inferno is because we've got a little poetry reading group at church.

05:32.90
Stan Lemon
We're reading Dante's Inferno. um And yeah, I mean, it's it's been good.

05:38.67
Jon
Is this only poetry that you've been reading, or is this an offshoot of like when you were reading all your classics?

05:44.50
Stan Lemon
This is an offshoot. This is totally unrelated to my classic stint. And the classic stint has been largely driven by Lucy's curriculum, which is why I'm reading the Father Brown stuff, which I don't know. Have you read much, Chesterton?

05:56.54
Jon
I have not. I'm trying to think if I've read anything.

05:59.45
Stan Lemon
So I vaguely recall reading part of...

06:01.19
Jon
Oh, I read Everlasting Man or something like that.

06:04.15
Stan Lemon
Oh, okay. All right. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:05.23
Jon
I think that's all that I've read, though.

06:06.97
Stan Lemon
Everlasting Man and then Orthodoxy, those are pretty popular texts. I think I read portions of Orthodoxy. I don't know why. i have this like... I had this unfounded aversion to Chesterton. So like i had to i had to build myself up to read Father Brown and i actually kind of enjoy It's like a little, um Father Brown's a priest, but he he's kind of like a Sherlock Holmes type character.

06:30.55
Stan Lemon
And his solving of crimes seems to be at least correlated to the fact that he hears confessions. And so he really deeply understands bad people this is the gist.

06:41.74
Jon
Nice.

06:42.50
Stan Lemon
Yeah, it's not bad. It's not bad. So Lucy's got to read it. So I've been reading that. um

06:47.22
Jon
Historically, I've been a book reading monotasker. like Generally, I have one book that I'm working on at a time. um But like I finally updated my Goodreads, and I think I have four in progress right now.

06:59.52
Jon
um So I am reading Julius Caesar.

07:00.08
Stan Lemon
Four.

07:02.61
Jon
um I have also started reading The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe out loud to my two-year-old as of the day this comes out.

07:08.77
Stan Lemon
Oh.

07:13.66
Jon
um and um What else do I have? Oh, finally i had a hold on the audiobook version of Sunrise on the Reaping, the newest ah installment in the Hunger Games world, um which is just okay so far.

07:28.60
Jon
um And then I've got...

07:29.27
Stan Lemon
why Why would you do that to yourself?

07:31.65
Jon
So I actually really liked A Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes. um And then like this one goes and it's looking at Hamish's Hunger Games. So...

07:43.67
Stan Lemon
I think, I mean, sometimes people just have to let a good thing lie. i mean, if if you think those books were good, but um know it's just, I don't know.

07:51.47
Jon
They weren't. The first movie was okay.

07:57.40
Stan Lemon
I, I guess, I mean, it's been so long since I've seen it. Yeah. I don't know. That's, this is, we're in, we're in dystopian space too, but it's like teen dystopian and I'm not really sure that it's, um, there's, there's like a nostalgic element as I sit here and think about it. I don't know that it was actually a good book, Jonathan.

08:16.46
Jon
I don't think it was, but I thought it was like a decent first movie.

08:17.89
Stan Lemon
Okay.

08:19.61
Jon
But then it's just literally the same thing over and over again.

08:19.98
Stan Lemon
He's in first movie.

08:24.89
Stan Lemon
So, uh,

08:24.98
Jon
And then it goes weird. but

08:27.48
Stan Lemon
You are reading a, you're reading of Witch from Wardrobe, Wardrobe, excuse me. You are not doing a picture book though, right?

08:42.32
Jon
I'm not doing a picture book. I do have the one um with illustrations on some of the pages throughout it.

08:50.17
Stan Lemon
Okay. Okay. I was just looking to see, see, we um, when we read, when my, I shouldn't say we, when my wife read Harry Potter to the children, there was a beautifully illustrated version of the first three books.

09:03.44
Jon
Oh, yes. Yes, I wanted to get those.

09:05.93
Stan Lemon
They're,

09:06.94
Jon
I think that they the fourth one came out at least.

09:11.21
Stan Lemon
Really? that That book is quite a bit longer, so i don't I don't know.

09:12.34
Jon
Maybe.

09:14.77
Stan Lemon
I mean, the thing about the first three books, right, is they are not terribly long, and because of the age of Harry, right, they're, I think, approachable or appropriate for someone who might be looking at a picture book, or an illustrated book, I should say.

09:29.33
Stan Lemon
i keep saying picture book, an illustrated book. um What I was just noticing is there's no illustrated version of The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. There are abridged um Illustrator versions, but I don't, I don't like, I don't know why you would abridge this book.

09:42.83
Jon
Yep.

09:46.59
Jon
I mean, like, if you're wanting a board book to introduce characters, I could see it, but then your goal is something different than what the book was intended for.

09:56.49
Stan Lemon
Yeah. And this is not a long book and it's, it's, it's exceptionally approachable. So this, this bothers me.

10:03.33
Jon
We have been getting through about two chapters at a time ah better than I could have ever dreamed.

10:10.28
Stan Lemon
Okay. Oh, here's a, here's a, um, heavy hard bound 528 page book that says it's, it says, that Oh, full, full color illustrations, but it's not like a fully illustrated book.

10:11.43
Jon
So...

10:28.03
Stan Lemon
Okay. Wow. These are lovely pictures too, but this is like a $70 single volume of the the Chronicles of Narnia. I don't, I don't think you want that. Yeah. All right. Well, that's that's awesome. That's one of, think, ah the the other day, Evelyn, my daughter, was asking what my favorite book was.

10:45.00
Stan Lemon
And what do you, well, I mean, I kind of spoiled it because um we're talking about The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe. But her first guess was not that. Her first guess was actually Lord of the Rings, which is a good guess.

10:54.95
Jon
Yep.

10:55.05
Stan Lemon
But Lion, Witch, and Wardrobe, hands down my favorite book.

10:59.16
Jon
Nice.

10:59.53
Stan Lemon
So, there you go.

10:59.62
Jon
Where does Slaughterhouse-Five rank in this list?

11:02.90
Stan Lemon
Slaughterhouse-Fot. It's not... i i didn

11:06.88
Jon
Not Top 5.

11:07.97
Stan Lemon
No, it's not top five. I enjoy Vonnegut a lot, but I don't know that I would put him near the top. I mean, like Lord of the Rings is probably number two or number three, to be honest with you. um But I don't know.

11:18.36
Jon
I feel like you have entered this phase of life now where this list probably changes on a fairly frequent basis too.

11:18.82
Stan Lemon
the

11:27.01
Jon
Because like if I mention the screw tape letters,

11:27.32
Stan Lemon
Oh, I don't know.

11:30.21
Jon
like

11:33.03
Stan Lemon
Is that in the top five? That's a good question. I don't know.

11:38.26
Stan Lemon
it could be. I'm not certain as we speak about it now. I am slated to read that novel again here this second semester. So I'll be able to give a a better assessment of there. i was I was actually trying to sit and think like, so To Kill Mockingbird's always been in my my top five. It's probably three.

11:59.07
Stan Lemon
I debate on whether or not it would be three or two. I really love that book. Like that's just, that's just one of my favorites of all time.

12:03.97
Jon
So much so that you have not read Ghosts Out Watchmen, right?

12:08.12
Stan Lemon
No. And I, and I never will.

12:10.06
Jon
Right.

12:10.87
Stan Lemon
Yeah. Um, if she had intended for that to be published, she would have done it. I think, uh, the critiques I've read of it ah have all like solidly convinced me I have no business reading it. Right. Right.

12:25.22
Jon
I have read it, and I would agree.

12:27.99
Stan Lemon
yeah was What's funny about that is you don't even like to kill a mockingbird.

12:31.65
Jon
I like to kill a mockingbird.

12:33.34
Stan Lemon
I thought you didn't like to kill mockingbird.

12:35.42
Jon
I could own a copy of To Kill a Mockingbird.

12:38.11
Stan Lemon
Well, that doesn't mean you yeah that you like it, Jonathan. That just means you own it.

12:42.65
Jon
I like To Kill a Mockingbird.

12:44.19
Stan Lemon
Okay. All right. I miss misremembered. For some reason, I had it.

12:47.10
Jon
I did not read it when I was supposed to read it in high school, but when I revisited it, I liked it.

12:52.31
Stan Lemon
So I don't actually think I had to read it in high school. I don't...

12:56.73
Jon
That's because you skipped a bunch of years, Stan.

12:56.92
Stan Lemon
i don't

12:59.81
Jon
You skipped one year of high school.

12:59.99
Stan Lemon
No, I don't, I'm telling you i don't think it was in the year I skipped either. um i think they, i think they did, gosh, am I remembering this right? I think they did Brit Lit the year that I skipped.

13:13.50
Stan Lemon
So I like, it just wasn't, it wasn't on the list, right? Like it wasn't something that I, that I did, but um yeah, i don't know. I, the, another one that would be in the top five would probably be a Warbreaker by Brandon Sanderson.

13:26.43
Stan Lemon
So yeah, yeah.

13:26.97
Jon
OK, nice. My hope is that you will read East of Eden this year by Steinbeck.

13:34.81
Stan Lemon
i I have enjoyed Steinbeck. I know Steinbeck can be very ah polarizing, very controversial. um I have genuinely enjoyed Steinbeck. So I would...

13:45.37
Jon
East of Eden is fantastic. I think it took me about two and a half years to get through when I read it. um But you are a much more diligent reader than I was at the time.

13:55.10
Stan Lemon
Okay, well, I'll cue that up. I struggle with trying to figure out if I would plop... the first Mistborn in the top five. I'm also a big fan of Fahrenheit 451. And i think that would probably be in the top five.

14:10.39
Stan Lemon
Maybe.

14:10.43
Jon
Interesting.

14:11.39
Stan Lemon
Yeah. I love cheaper by the dozen. That's a, that's a, like people usually think about that one. That's a one of my favorite books. You should read that to Lily.

14:18.55
Jon
I saw the movie.

14:20.51
Stan Lemon
The movies are nothing, unless you're watching the old school black and white one, which also cuts a lot of corners.

14:25.00
Jon
I did not. Okay.

14:26.11
Stan Lemon
Um, cheaper by the dozen, i the book is just totally different. It's, and it's a, it's a tearjerker too. Great Gatsby. That's the one that you don't like that. I love.

14:36.15
Jon
Yes, I do not like Great Gatsby, but apparently I have to give it another try.

14:36.44
Stan Lemon
um

14:40.28
Stan Lemon
I think that's a book too you should you should read with people. There's there's just so much depth there.

14:43.15
Jon
Okay.

14:45.95
Stan Lemon
So I know, John, those are just the ones that come to the top of my mind. I'm not really sure that I'm going to swear my life on the ordering that I just rattled off, but I know um The Lion, The Witch, The Wardrobe is is number one. So there's a cartoon version of The Lion, The Witch, The Wardrobe, which my elementary school had on VHS and would play like when we had a rain day or whatever.

15:11.48
Stan Lemon
And I know you're, you're looking at me like I'm crazy right now, but I have,

15:14.99
Jon
I'm trying to think if I've seen an animated version. like I remember the old like the old series with the goofy stuff going on that we watched in school.

15:26.07
Stan Lemon
this, this is animated. It's a, it's a full on cartoon for whatever reason, my element elementary school had the line, the witch in the wardrobe and Ricky Tiki Tabby. And they're both animated and those were the two options, right? And you could only watch one because another class had the other one, right? And so, you know, it was what it was.

15:44.83
Stan Lemon
But anyhow, I actually would recommend you look into it because... When your daughter gets to be my kid's age, she will have no interest in cartoons of that sort because there's not enough there's not enough going on. But at this age, I bet she likes it.

16:01.40
Stan Lemon
So after you're done, I'm sure it's on YouTube. yeah I'm sure you can find it. It's got to be out there. Okay. um

16:08.91
Jon
Do want to talk Julius Caesar? I think you're slightly more ahead of me. I

16:12.99
Stan Lemon
I'm slightly more ahead of you. Spoiler alert, he dies. I think i think we should wait to talk about it until until we're both done. So I do have a question about pacing. Are you trying to hit like a certain pace with this book or what are you doing?

16:27.33
Jon
have not. My goal was Q1. I'm going to blow that out of the water. um Because like things are picking up now, too.

16:32.22
Stan Lemon
Okay.

16:34.81
Jon
um So like if I wasn't...

16:37.21
Stan Lemon
We said you're in your act two, right?

16:39.42
Jon
I finished Act 2.

16:40.89
Stan Lemon
Okay, all right, so he's dead.

16:43.42
Jon
No, that's Act 3.

16:45.24
Stan Lemon
act three is that Is that scene one of Act 3? Yeah, I guess it is.

16:47.77
Jon
Yes.

16:48.55
Stan Lemon
Okay. so i alright Sorry, John. i'm i'm um

16:52.52
Jon
Spoilers.

16:53.79
Stan Lemon
Julius Caesar dies. Hey, guess what? couple of people stabbed him too. ah Actually, not a couple. Six or seven.

17:00.12
Jon
Six or seven, yeah.

17:00.41
Stan Lemon
ah Six or seven. Yeah. ah No. So i'm I'm at the end of scene two of Act 3. And so, um yeah, i ah let's let's talk when you get there. i'm I'm not trying to read too much at a time. i had been reading one scene a day, i not really totally sure what your pacing was going to be. I read two scenes today, i think, maybe three, because I had time and I was enjoying it. But Jonathan, I don't know if you do this. I read a good portion of it out loud.

17:30.49
Jon
I have not been doing that, but you did tell me that you've been reading it out loud.

17:33.91
Stan Lemon
Yeah, out loud to myself, I i was sitting downstairs at 6 a.m. in the dark, except for the fireplace, which I'd turned on, and a cup of coffee.

17:44.27
Jon
What? You turned on the fireplace?

17:47.00
Stan Lemon
I turned on the fireplace, yeah.

17:48.35
Jon
Wow.

17:49.11
Stan Lemon
Yeah. So yeah, I was all by myself. My toes were a little little chilly, and I thought, I'm going to put the fireplace on, and I'm going to read i'm go to read out loud to myself. And i have an awesome soothsayer voice. I'm just going to leave that of there you to think about

18:03.96
Jon
Okay, we have a new goal to try to get that on the podcast.

18:06.78
Stan Lemon
<unk> try I don't know about that. i don't know about that. um Okay. So we I think we save Julius Caesar for when we we finish up. i did um we We haven't talked about AI in a bit and I wanted to i wanted to float an idea about you.

18:21.43
Stan Lemon
So I have this recurring experience with people largely at work, but also in my my spare life or my spare life, my spare time in my real life, in my non-work life, where I tell people how I use like ChatGPT or, you know, just AI in general.

18:38.65
Stan Lemon
Right. And they seem amazed. And I think that we have a series we're going to call AI pro tips, but we're not pros and they're not really tips.

18:42.45
Jon
Cam?

18:48.60
Stan Lemon
They're just how we use it.

18:49.79
Jon
I mean, you're kind of a pro.

18:50.11
Stan Lemon
I think, I'm not a pro. I'm not a pro. But here's here's what I think. I think we should talk about how we use it. And just like, so I'm to go this week. And there's an example.

19:01.09
Jon
Cam?

19:01.63
Stan Lemon
Next episode, you're responsible for figuring out something you do with AI that let's say your mother would consider a pro tip, but it's just how you how you do business.

19:05.99
Jon
That's interesting.

19:11.34
Stan Lemon
What think?

19:11.70
Jon
my mother's afraid of AI, but okay. um

19:14.87
Stan Lemon
right. Well, somebody else's mother.

19:15.03
Jon
Give me more context. Like, why are they amazed? Or is this an example of why they're amazed?

19:21.69
Stan Lemon
Well, I think there's a lack of imagination in and it's just because they're used to a very binary input, output oriented computer that does things in uncreative ways.

19:32.79
Stan Lemon
Right. So you're,

19:33.79
Jon
So they're basically using it like Google.

19:36.06
Stan Lemon
Yeah, exactly. Right. So, and I think most people probably fall into the, uh, AI as a, as a replacement for Google trap. Right. Um, so here's, here's something I did today. i gave it a piece of content.

19:50.94
Stan Lemon
Um, it's, uh, I'll just, I'll explain exactly what it is. So it's, it's a appointment with a nutritionist to talk about, Well, nutrition and like lifestyle stuff, right? So I copied the prompt into a chat GPT conversation and I was like, hey, I want you to give me some ideas on what I should do in this appointment because it's just like the the description is just generic enough to like...

20:15.96
Stan Lemon
Get you sign up, but not, not like, not a lot of brainstorms a whole bunch of stuff.

20:16.26
Jon
Sure.

20:20.12
Stan Lemon
Right. And I'm scrolling and trying to type. And then i was like, you know what? I don't know why I'm like trying to like keep track of what it said and like respond to it. So I said, Hey, um, these are great ideas.

20:33.37
Stan Lemon
I would like you to ask me question by question until we can fill it all in. Right. And that that thing, right, where you you say, give me some recommendations and it throws a whole bunch of stuff at you and you're like, okay now we're going to have a conversation, like a literal conversation.

20:46.21
Jon
Sure.

20:46.98
Stan Lemon
Ask me a question. I don't think people think about telling AI to ask you a question. Right. Or even to do like to actually have the AI orchestrate the multi-turn conversation. Right. Right. So, so you can imagine, like I give it and it's like, Hey, so first of all, um, tell me what your six to 12 month goal is. Right.

21:08.47
Stan Lemon
And I do that. Okay, cool. Tell me how old you are, like what height you are. Right. And I give that. And then it's like, all right, so let's talk about your current medications. Right. And this is literally the conversation that it's having based upon the prompt, because it's trying to build enough information for me to go into this, this nutritionist meeting I'm going to have.

21:25.63
Jon
So for this, were you interfacing through the keyboard, or were you in advanced voice mode?

21:32.47
Stan Lemon
So this this actually was on the keyboard. Maybe it's more natural when I do it on voice, but in this particular situation, I had a block of text and I was already sitting on my laptop. And so I dropped it in.

21:43.77
Stan Lemon
And this, the other thing too, is this is a... This is not a sit down and do it all at once kind of thing.

21:50.92
Jon
Right.

21:51.00
Stan Lemon
This is a, I'm going to work on a little now. I'm going to work on a little later. I'm going to work on it a little later yet. Right. And so it's asked me a question. I'm going to answer it, go do some other stuff. It's going me another question. I may or may not get to tonight. I don't know.

22:04.73
Stan Lemon
Right. But it allows me to start like a project, if you will, around trying to prepare for this meeting with a nutritionist.

22:14.71
Jon
Yeah, I think that's how I generally use AI. Occasionally I'll do like quick answer things. um But I think I told you before I left for Disney that i basically created a report based off of meeting notes. And throughout the course of that conversation to get to the final product, ChatGPT asked me something like 85 questions total. um And I spent four hours producing this document, which without it probably would have taken me at least three days.

22:44.95
Stan Lemon
And I know that this is more natural for you, at least on the chat CPT side. I have a habit for whatever reason of not doing this, but when I do it, it's it's cold. The funny thing is when I'm doing coding, I fall into this pattern all the time consistently, right?

23:00.06
Stan Lemon
Like, Hey, what do you think about this Ask me some questions.

23:01.49
Jon
That's because that's your like how you are normally functioning in your day-to-day life.

23:08.12
Stan Lemon
I guess so. I guess so. It's just, I've been trying to get myself to do it more for the non-coding oriented things. It's starting to come along. So, you know, i'm I'm excited about, but that's my AI tip. Basically tell ChatGPT or Claude or nobody should be using Grok. Or if you're using Gemini, Gemini is okay. So Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT or Poplexy, you want to use one. But basically to say like, hey, I'm Ask me question by question, right?

23:37.41
Stan Lemon
That's the key question by question to get through this conversation. Right. And then just see what's going on there.

23:41.02
Jon
Yeah, I often tell it to slow down too because it will like dump a whole bunch of content at me. And it's like, I don't want to answer 10 questions in this text box right now.

23:51.03
Jon
um So let's take them one at a time.

23:51.52
Stan Lemon
Right. Right.

23:53.40
Jon
so

23:53.72
Stan Lemon
And that's that's where I think question by question or one question at a time, right, is is a really key instruction to give it. I do not recommend putting that, though, in your ChatGPT instructions because everything gets tedious.

24:06.52
Jon
That would be annoying real fast.

24:08.06
Stan Lemon
Yeah. yeah But it's but it's it's kind of a power play to work through a more complex conversation and to compile information. Because I think i think that's the the real key there, right? If you want it to do something for you, sometimes it needs to learn first about it. And so you say, hey, ask me question by question, one question at time, whatever, however you want to say it.

24:25.75
Stan Lemon
And it will use that to then build up and generate the the response for you. um

24:31.10
Jon
Kind of related, ah you know, like the the phrase, like, you don't know what you don't know.

24:36.51
Stan Lemon
Yeah.

24:37.43
Jon
So all the time I ask chat GPT, um what am I overlooking or forgetting or missing? um And then it will come back with more context or something that you might be missing too.

24:51.10
Stan Lemon
Yeah, again, I do this with code quite a bit just in terms of what have I not considered, right? What potential issues might crop up? I also like to ask it, like when I'm giving you instructions to go do work, um what remains ambiguous? What don't you understand? Do you have any questions for me? Sometimes just saying, do you have any questions for me is one of the like best things you can tack on to the end of any prompt, you know? um And, you know, I... like I know about doing this because of you. I just aspire to do it in my non-code-centric.

25:24.22
Jon
I think that's because that's kind of my way of life to the point that Anna, my wife, gets annoyed with me because I ask too many questions. um But like that's that's where I thrive. I need to figure out how things are functioning, what's working, what's not working. And that's what I do for a paycheck. so

25:43.80
Stan Lemon
There you go. all right. Hey, um on a little bit of AI news, did you see the announcement from Claude this week on Co-Work?

25:49.95
Jon
I saw the announcement. um I haven't played with it or taken a deep dive. Hmm.

25:56.02
Stan Lemon
Well, think you have to be a Max user, which is the $100 subscription in order to try it right now. Oh, it actually it says research preview for Pro. So the $20 plan will have access to Co-Work. I wonder if they updated that because I feel like when it first launched, it was just for Max.

26:11.07
Stan Lemon
So, co-work is similar conceptually to the way that Cloud Code or Codex would work, right? Where you point at a folder and it does work. But now, instead of being code-centric, like you pointed at a folder on your desktop, right?

26:20.67
Jon
Yep.

26:25.59
Stan Lemon
PDFs, images, docs, like Word docs, whatever.

26:27.15
Jon
Google Drive.

26:28.07
Stan Lemon
Yeah, whatever.

26:28.11
Jon
Yeah.

26:28.83
Stan Lemon
Yeah, exactly, right? And then you you work from that collection of information. I'm pretty excited about this. I haven't had a chance to to use it yet. I don't currently have a Claude Code subscription, but I think this is directionally powerful.

26:45.95
Stan Lemon
And it'll be interesting to see how it plays out. It's only on macOS, which is interesting its own right. I don't know how you do this on iOS, if ever.

26:52.41
Jon
So,

26:55.74
Jon
right. I mean, it's got to be Apple's AI tooling if they ever come up with it.

27:01.26
Stan Lemon
We'll get that. We'll get that. Yeah.

27:03.19
Jon
But what I was going to say is we've seen, um I've seen versions of this kind of thing specifically in HubSpot AI tools. um So like when these are customer facing AI tools, you don't want it going out to the internet for information.

00:01.40
Jon
So like I've seen stuff in this proprietary um space.

00:05.45
Stan Lemon
Thank you.

00:06.04
Jon
um So it seems only natural, especially as the AI tools um try to move out of the early adopters who are used to writing code, things like that.

00:16.08
Jon
So like coding tools was a natural step to take and now starting to move out into really other business systems and how people are working and solving real pain points there.

00:28.06
Stan Lemon
I think it'll be interesting to So first of all, like in some respects, they're chasing Gemini a little bit, right? Gemini already has deep integration into Google Docs.

00:33.92
Jon
Sure.

00:37.27
Stan Lemon
I look at this and I wonder like, is box.com or is Dropbox still a thing?

00:42.55
Jon
I think they still exist, yes.

00:44.31
Stan Lemon
Okay. Like this would be a heck of a play for them. i think they're probably woefully behind on the whole um AI thing. chat thing, but, you know, they've got access to to files. Apple could do this if apple Apple had half a brain about, you know, ah doing AI and LMS.

01:03.19
Stan Lemon
And maybe, Jonathan, maybe that's as good a segue as any into the topic du jour of the day.

01:10.78
Jon
ah Is this the one that we teased at the end of last week's episode?

01:16.22
Stan Lemon
Did we tease? I don't remember. Did we tease at the end?

01:18.01
Jon
Maybe it was off air, but I thought we did.

01:19.93
Stan Lemon
of Okay. So,

01:21.50
Jon
Has the HomePod got it worse?

01:23.38
Stan Lemon
Has the HomePod gotten worse? And i think since we recorded, what's been interesting is Apple and Google made a huge announcement about Gemini, right?

01:31.16
Jon
Right

01:33.27
Stan Lemon
Coming to the iOS ecosystem and basically becoming Apple's LLM of choice. So this is fascinating to me because we i presume the way I interpret this is that Gemini is going to power the um the Siri of all things Apple, right?

01:52.48
Jon
It's not.

01:53.18
Stan Lemon
maybe on the HomePod, definitely on the on the phone. the yeah you know it's It's like a well-known story. Apple says they're going to do a whole bunch of things with Siri. They have done absolutely none of them. They've released a whole new version of their operating system since they said they've and they've done nothing.

02:10.23
Stan Lemon
the most that we got was really ChatGPT can be exercised from Siri, but it's not it's not really a natural flow. I don't know. I wanted to ask you, like, how often do you use that? Do you say, hey Siri. i Sorry, I'm going to activate everything. Sorry. Hey, dingus.

02:27.51
Stan Lemon
Ask ChatGPT XYZ.

02:30.78
Jon
I have once, like when the feature was released. Hey, there you go. you've You've made the robots angry.

02:36.18
Stan Lemon
Yeah, can you hear it? Yeah, i mean...

02:38.16
Jon
Thankfully, they aren't the ah sentient ones. so

02:40.79
Stan Lemon
I wonder if that'll come through the recording.

02:41.82
Jon
but

02:42.31
Stan Lemon
So so dear listener, I have a HomePod in my office. She is angry right now, wanting to know what I need. And it's it's kind of ironic.

02:50.82
Jon
But it was nice that you listened to your activation phrase.

02:53.50
Stan Lemon
Yeah, she likes to do my activation phrase, which is comical because most of the time she doesn't, right?

02:58.51
Jon
Correct.

02:59.48
Stan Lemon
To to the point that i'm I'm actually like, I don't know. It's so unreliable right now that I find myself actually just pulling out my phone and holding the button. right?

03:10.27
Stan Lemon
In order to in order to trigger dingus.

03:10.39
Jon
Yeah.

03:11.49
Stan Lemon
The one time

03:13.66
Jon
And then on the phone, she probably understands you.

03:14.01
Stan Lemon
a one the one time

03:16.48
Jon
But on the HomePod, it's like, I've had terrible results recently.

03:21.20
Stan Lemon
Oh, it's hit or miss. It really really is hit or miss. there's There's something weird too where my wife at the end of the day will come in and say, hey, Dingus, turn off my lamp, right?

03:31.94
Stan Lemon
And for whatever reason, Jonathan, my phone picks up her serial request.

03:37.90
Jon
Mm-hmm.

03:39.16
Stan Lemon
But I'm always reading on the Kindle and like I go to swipe. Yeah. HomePod's still in the background wanting to know what's going on. ah so so the But like as soon as I swipe on Kindle, it then dismisses the Siri interaction.

03:54.25
Stan Lemon
So like I picked up her voice but didn't know how to respond fast enough. to it's just It's just maddening. it really is maddening.

04:00.50
Jon
Why is your phone picking up her voice?

04:03.90
Stan Lemon
It shouldn't, right? It shouldn't at all.

04:05.08
Jon
Right.

04:06.45
Stan Lemon
There's a HomePod in the room. There's her phone and her iPad. All of them have the hey dingus thing going, right?

04:13.77
Jon
Yep.

04:14.42
Stan Lemon
And my phone is technically closest to her voice, but also has only been trained for my voice. So it should not be picking her up. And Jonathan, i don't know if you've noticed, Mrs.

04:21.07
Jon
Yep.

04:22.87
Stan Lemon
Lemon does not sound like me.

04:24.27
Jon
No, she does not.

04:25.46
Stan Lemon
Yeah. But that's just the voice recognition part. I think the part you're really annoyed about is like, does it do the thing you tell it to do?

04:33.53
Jon
So specifically, um i have one in the living room. And like what I use it for the most now is to play a song, um right?

04:45.69
Jon
And half the time, it will not play the song that I actually asked for, which is very frustrating and sometimes dangerous when you're trying to play a song for your two-year-old.

04:56.98
Stan Lemon
Oh, yeah. So <unk>ve I've gotten some really weird K-pop songs that come up when asking for a Jimmy Buffett jam, right?

05:03.04
Jon
Mm-hmm.

05:05.22
Stan Lemon
And like like I'm sorry. i don't believe that there is any universe in which a computer should confuse K-pop and Jimmy Buffett. like i think I think they're very different extremes.

05:16.09
Stan Lemon
I think saying...

05:16.34
Jon
Well, and like, it doesn't matter how specific you are.

05:16.97
Stan Lemon
we've

05:19.22
Jon
You can give the song title and artist, or you can give a whole album name and it will still mess it up.

05:26.04
Stan Lemon
Yeah, I had actually stopped. so So I feel like when it first came out, the the HomePod first came out, There were three things that I did pretty regularly, right?

05:37.35
Stan Lemon
Hey, dingus, play this song.

05:38.02
Jon
Mm-hmm.

05:39.26
Stan Lemon
Hey, dingus, turn the lights on, right?

05:39.31
Jon
Yep.

05:43.61
Stan Lemon
And then the final one was, hey, dingus, set a timer for 10 minutes or whatever, right? Like, especially in baking. i don't think I don't think the timer is a capability of the HomePod anymore.

05:55.00
Stan Lemon
i like i i they don't They don't work. They straight up don't work. And I am not doing anything different than I was doing two years ago. This is where I think that they they really, i don't know if they're, I don't know what's going on, but it's it's not good. And heaven forbid, I do something more interesting, like ask it.

06:15.58
Stan Lemon
Hey, Siri. oh Oh, shoot.

06:19.42
Jon
Sorry, dear listeners.

06:19.54
Stan Lemon
it lit up. Sorry, Jaylisters. That's going awful. And I don't have the ability to edit this out. But if I if i said, hey, Dingus, is there a calendar event this week that has the word recycling in it?

06:31.37
Stan Lemon
Which is a request I asked today because I was like, is this a recycling week? Right? And, you know, it came back and it says there's no calendar event called recycling today. Well, you know, no kidding because it's not trash pickup day.

06:44.76
Jon
Well, that's better than saying, here, let me tell you about recycling.

06:44.92
Stan Lemon
But

06:47.76
Jon
Or you can learn more by asking from your iPhone.

06:52.55
Stan Lemon
But there is an event on Wednesday, and I said this week, right? So it should have been able to figure that out. Reminders is another one that drives me nuts. I'll say, hey, dingus, add such and such as a reminder to my you know coding list or whatever.

07:07.58
Jon
Yep.

07:07.86
Stan Lemon
And what it does is it puts the whole stinking sentence as a reminder. And it it even gets a little more ugly when I do something like, hey, dingus, add a reminder, um you know, I don't i don't know, bake bread today, right? if i type If I type that in, it would suggest to me today as a due date for the reminder.

07:34.07
Stan Lemon
But instead, via Siri, it, oh, there I did it again, Jonathan. It's so impossible not to say. It puts the word today in the in the like name for the reminder, which is which is actually kind of worse because now it's missed one of the most critical pieces of that reminder, which is I want to be told about it today.

07:49.37
Jon
People are reminded of it. Yep.

07:50.72
Stan Lemon
Yeah. Ah.

07:52.82
Jon
And what makes this the worst is that the HomePod was better than this when we first bought it.

08:02.49
Stan Lemon
Yeah, yeah. The HomePod was materially better because I actually bought i bought four of them, Jonathan.

08:03.29
Jon
And...

08:07.70
Stan Lemon
I have four of them deployed to my house.

08:08.19
Jon
Right. So we've seen it going down in performance while technical capabilities in basically the new space that this should be excelling in um have gone off the charts.

08:22.52
Stan Lemon
Yeah. And for whatever reason, they did not bring any of that ChatGPT integration into it when they rolled out the, actually, it was actually the previous version now of HomePod OS.

08:30.52
Jon
Right.

08:34.17
Jon
At least they didn't release you know a brand new HomePod and then have it not work.

08:41.20
Stan Lemon
Oh, I'm sure that's coming. I'm sure that's coming because this is now a pretty old device, right? It's gotten worse in my house. And that raises an interesting question. Like if they release a new version tomorrow, would you buy it?

08:54.20
Jon
ah Tomorrow? Probably not.

08:56.31
Stan Lemon
Okay, what about two months from now?

08:59.05
Jon
Depending on reviews and how they showcase it, maybe.

09:02.52
Stan Lemon
Yeah, I and don't, can you?

09:03.29
Jon
like i love I love this device. I bought two of them. I am cheap. I

09:10.10
Stan Lemon
but But think about this. So the showcasing the device, because of what they did with Siri, would you would you actually trust them showcasing a new LLM?

09:21.78
Jon
think I would trust the commentary around it.

09:26.42
Stan Lemon
Yeah, i don't know. In a controlled space? Maybe. I don't know. I'm i'm so i'm super skeptical. i know you know Amazon has been at it. Google's been at it with their home devices.

09:36.69
Stan Lemon
Amazon overhauled. i' have been super, super curious about going and trying out one of the new Lexus.

09:41.19
Jon
Yeah, because our smart home days started with Alexa devices.

09:45.85
Stan Lemon
they They did, and they started off with programmatic skills, and and they were cool. they were They were super cool. Now, I don't know. to Am I... Am I like willing to get back into the Alexa ecosystem?

10:00.37
Stan Lemon
I don't, I don't think so. But also like, I'm not sure how much longer this HomePod nonsense can go on before I just stopped telling, like i start telling like, don't, don't answer any more queries.

10:06.55
Jon
Right.

10:10.57
Stan Lemon
You're just a speaker. You know, we could be close that to be honest you. We could be close to that. Um,

10:16.37
Jon
I mean, a lot of times it is when I have to go look up a song on my phone and then cast it to the HomePod.

10:23.20
Stan Lemon
I can't remember the last time I didn't cast it to a home pod. And here's the thing too, airplay has gotten worse in the last couple of years as well, right?

10:32.15
Jon
I think you probably use AirPlay more than I do. So I don't know that I've noticed.

10:34.42
Stan Lemon
Yeah, well, oh, AirPlay can be such trash. i just I just feel like for whatever reason, those things should have gotten smarter and have gotten worse. And it it is is very undermining to the Apple ecosystem because I really want these capabilities. And I will find them eventually somewhere else. And i will I will drink whatever Kool-Aid I need to enter whatever cultic community of you know Google users that are out there, like whatever it is.

10:59.93
Stan Lemon
I will probably do that, right? Because I've already sacrificed my soul to open AI. They've got all my information. You know, they know my blood type. They know they know everything.

11:08.44
Jon
And like Apple should know more um with access to your email and calendar and everything else, documents, photos.

11:08.47
Stan Lemon
So...

11:18.55
Jon
I

11:19.67
Stan Lemon
Yeah, absolutely. You know, actually, this is an interesting thing. I meant to to link you. I might have said, I think you were, were you still in California when when this happened? The ChatGPT Apple Health integration announcement. Did you see this?

11:33.07
Jon
did not see this. Did you send it to me?

11:34.17
Stan Lemon
Okay. Maybe i maybe i held back because of, I didn't want to bother you.

11:38.23
Jon
Because I was standing in line for Rise of the Resistance.

11:41.08
Stan Lemon
so So basically, ChatGPT is coming out with a new product called ChatGPT Health. And you can you can hop on and join the wait list. They got a cool video. They got some good collateral about it.

11:52.95
Stan Lemon
But what looks pretty cool, or you know maybe more cool to me, is you can you will be able to connect Apple Health and potentially other wellness apps into your ChatGPT Health.

12:05.81
Jon
Hmm.

12:06.87
Stan Lemon
And so, you know, I have, as you know, we've talked about this before, right? I am all in on Apple Health. Apple Health has all of my data, all of it.

12:14.08
Jon
Yep.

12:14.93
Stan Lemon
And... um i I put a lot of health and wellness information in chat GPT already. So the idea of like mirroring those or being able to ask it ah questions about the data, like the authoritative data in Apple health, I'm pretty excited about. Now, some people are going to freak out because, you know, you're exposing a lot of personal health information, right? To an LLM.

12:41.33
Stan Lemon
i I feel like it's going to be worth it. I go back to some of the, some of the like Eurekas that I've had in the last six months using chat GPT for health stuff. So like my shoulder issue, right? Chat GPT diagnosing why my shoulder, like what I did to hurt my shoulder and why it wasn't getting better.

12:59.19
Stan Lemon
Craziness, right?

12:59.25
Jon
Yep.

13:00.44
Stan Lemon
um I've already talked about like managing nutrition, but also i had, I take a vitamin, right? And I probably shouldn't say this on the podcast.

13:12.63
Stan Lemon
Why not? My urine glows in the dark now, right? And that's that's weird. Turns out it's one of the things that's in the vitamins. I i was like completely freaked out as one would be, right? But Chachi PT was like, hey, I hear you. your urine glows in the dark. It just so happens that you previously told me about this vitamin and it has this ingredient. And was like, really? Well, there you go.

13:37.04
Stan Lemon
doesn't really glow in the dark people. It's just, it's, it's neon yellow. Yeah. And I know, I know this is more information. Maybe I need know, but like, think about this, right? That's the kind of thing that chat GPT is already doing. And it it doesn't have access to all my information yet.

13:51.38
Stan Lemon
You know, 20

13:51.89
Jon
And you're paying 20 bucks a month for it.

13:56.02
Stan Lemon
bucks for it. here's Here's the thing too.

13:57.17
Jon
how How many ah tests and things would it take your doctor to figure this out?

13:57.30
Stan Lemon
There's, there's been rumors.

14:03.51
Stan Lemon
Well, my doctor quite a bit. um Yeah, no, there's there's like, I don't necessarily want it to be a doctor for me. Like I don't want it to do diagnostics. What I want it to do is collate information to give me questions to ask my medical professionals.

14:24.28
Stan Lemon
right and have a more intelligible conversation with them about the information. it's like I get my lab results, right? And I get a form letter generated through MyChart from them. And MyChart has like, you know, graphs and whatnot. And I have no idea, like there's nothing on MyChart that's looking at all of my blood work together as a story.

14:46.20
Stan Lemon
And I don't necessarily want to be just like good or bad, but I want it be like, Hey, this is something I might consider asking my doctor about when I go to look at my blood work together. That's the kind of thing that i would love to have happen. Now, interesting interestingly enough, Apple supposedly has some kind of, uh, Apple health premium service subscription theme, a bobber coming,

15:05.17
Stan Lemon
which could be cool. But again, like I think the best way to to do the next thing with all of that involves an LLM and an Apple, unless unless they just go all in with Gemini everywhere,

15:19.54
Stan Lemon
I just don't see them doing it. By the way, too, there's a huge difference between Gemini 2, 5, and 3. Like, if if you've tried Gemini and been frustrated, go give 3 a whirl. 3 is a huge improvement. Huge improvement. It's like going from 5.0 to 5.2 on ChatGPT, right?

15:36.97
Jon
That's one of my resolutions is to push AI to its limits.

15:40.44
Stan Lemon
Push AI systems, yeah. So, um what are you making this Apple announcement, though, with Gemini?

15:46.72
Jon
um I think that they made promises and then all their AI talent got sniped up. And so they're trying to pivot to a way where they can still provide AI, um even when right now it doesn't sound like they have anything interesting for ai developers to work on.

16:07.55
Stan Lemon
Yeah. And you know, going be honest with think the thing that's most concerning to me is this, this announcement makes it feel like it is that much further away.

16:17.08
Jon
Right.

16:17.66
Stan Lemon
You know, I, um, I hope that what they do, and this is probably not what's going happen. But I hope that the way that ChatGPT has been integrated into iOS is what they do with Gemini. So that you wind up, now you've got two options, right? and then then I hope they take it further and give it more of a commanding experience across the OS.

16:41.02
Stan Lemon
Because i do think I do think that the multi-model approach, there's i think there's a ton of value to that. And I think that Apple would benefit from having, you know, a multi-model.

16:53.60
Stan Lemon
And then if they want to do some like premium, very specific things that's using, you know, Gemini and their private cloud or whatever, cool. Absolutely. Go for it. But I am really, I first, i'm I'm really like anxious at the thought of,

17:10.87
Stan Lemon
it just being a like, you know, Google, Gemini and Android baked into iOS, right? Like both on on the side. I want, there's gotta be, there's gotta be some flexibility, I think for me.

17:23.16
Stan Lemon
I also don't know how the economics of this are going to play out either.

17:23.20
Jon
I will, right.

17:25.52
Stan Lemon
Cause very clearly they're not putting Gemini on my device, right? That was Apple's original promise was do a whole bunch of this on device. So that's not going to happen, you know?

17:35.41
Jon
Yeah. I don't know. We'll see how it shakes out. um It would be interesting to see ah where Steve Jobs had at would be at in this AI frontier.

17:51.39
Stan Lemon
I mean, you know, we could speculate ah he's he's dead, so it's like we'll never know. But I don't think he would have let Apple get be as behind as they are because I think they are embarrassingly behind right now.

18:07.16
Stan Lemon
um Next iOS is 26.3. We're in 26.2 right now. Rumor is it that the, or rumor has it, whatever the phrase is, the next AI version the thing that was promised you know a year and a half, two years ago now, comes out in 26.4.

18:24.75
Stan Lemon
That's been a lot of like widely held um rumor for a while now. So I'm curious to see maybe maybe before summer, will we get something interesting?

18:36.52
Jon
Maybe.

18:38.59
Stan Lemon
i don't know. Apple, Apple's just breaking my heart. So at what point, okay, let's just wrap up the HomePod discussion real quick. At what point do you unplug your HomePod and just be done with it?

18:50.71
Jon
i don't know, but I think we're close.

18:54.10
Stan Lemon
That bad, huh?

18:54.93
Jon
like I feel like a lot of the stuff they can fix with just a software update, but then software updates come and it's not fixed.

19:03.48
Stan Lemon
It's not fixed and things get less and less reliable. I finally, did I tell you about the light bulb situation?

19:10.61
Jon
Maybe.

19:12.11
Stan Lemon
So I had a bunch of Nanoleaf light bulbs in the house and i had ah set of older ones, my originals, that were just horribly unreliable.

19:23.98
Stan Lemon
Did a whole bunch of Googling, let Chachapiti do some research, basically found out that like when Apple upgraded the way they handle thread and matter, right?

19:35.58
Stan Lemon
The the home, smart home protocol stuff, um they basically ruined my light bulbs, right?

19:36.66
Jon
Protocols.

19:43.11
Jon
Hmm.

19:44.08
Stan Lemon
They don't play well with that. And so I was like, all right, well, I'll replace him because kind of grown attached these smart light bulbs. And I did, and they're much more responsive, right? I say, hey, turn on, hey, turn off.

19:57.07
Stan Lemon
And I've got more particular outcomes as long as I'm not using the HomePod.

20:00.21
Jon
True.

20:00.50
Stan Lemon
um But I've got this horrible problem where the one that is on my nightstand, I used to have, like I have an automation that will turn it on at 6.50 a.m. m at 10%.

20:12.57
Stan Lemon
At 10%, it is not jarring.

20:12.72
Jon
Hmm.

20:13.90
Stan Lemon
It will not wake me up, but I will wake up and there will be light already in the room. If I go to bed and I turn the light off at 100%, it doesn't matter what the automation set to It will turn it back on at 650 at 100%. You know what happens with 100% bright white LED?

20:30.35
Stan Lemon
I wake up every single time and it's a little bit jarring.

20:33.86
Jon
Yeah. Angry Stan.

20:36.70
Stan Lemon
It's just so it's so silly, man. like i really do think it's the regression of these things that is...

20:44.20
Jon
Right. Because we they have worked well.

20:47.09
Stan Lemon
They have worked well. they worked They worked so well, I bought more, right? I doubled down and now they've all degraded and they're they're a point now they're at a point now where i'm I'm thinking like, maybe I'll just go back to non-smart technology.

20:50.93
Jon
Right.

21:02.75
Jon
Right.

21:03.02
Stan Lemon
right? Just like a light switch. Maybe I'll try just a light switch, Jonathan, and I will get out of bed and I'll flip it. Or you know what I could do too? I could do the clappy thing because I think the clappy thing probably still works like it did 20 years ago when my grandma had one.

21:11.86
Jon
There you go.

21:16.80
Stan Lemon
That's my hypothesis.

21:18.29
Jon
There you go. Well, I guess we'll see.

21:19.61
Stan Lemon
All

21:21.20
Jon
ah Technology is improving, so like everything else would catch up, right?

21:26.74
Stan Lemon
You would think. It just doesn't seem to be that way. So, all right. Speaking of technology and and one more Apple dealio to go here. So I bought a new car. i won't go into a lot of detail about the new car today, but I've been wanting to talk to you a little bit about the HUD.

21:39.63
Stan Lemon
the um

21:39.84
Jon
Mm-hmm.

21:41.42
Stan Lemon
it HUD? Is that what they call it What is the autum the term?

21:45.09
Jon
Heads up to display.

21:45.26
Stan Lemon
Yeah, it's not a heads-up display, though. It's the automotive display. What do you call the display in a car? I thought there was a different term for it.

21:57.58
Stan Lemon
Yeah, it says heads-up display. so heads up No, that doesn't sound right, though, Jonathan. the The display in a car, right? So the... um

22:05.30
Jon
Are you talking about where your speedometer is, or are you talking about like the big tablet that they mounted where it used to have knobs and the radio and thing?

22:11.28
Stan Lemon
Well, the big, big tablet, although I've been driving a Honda Odyssey.

22:13.13
Jon
OK.

22:15.66
Stan Lemon
ah it's it's It's just about two years old, and I wouldn't call it a big tablet. I would say it's like, you know, original iPad mini sized. um And it's been fine. So it's it's CarPlay. I got to plug it in And I like CarPlay. I didn't have CarPlay before the Odyssey that I got two years ago.

22:37.14
Stan Lemon
But i like I also, it's so in the Honda, it's so disconnected from everything else that I was starting to understand why,

22:49.52
Stan Lemon
some people were not sold on it or why some of these big automakers were like, no, we're not going to do CarPlay. We're not going to Android Auto anymore. We're just going to do our own interface because it's kind of like I go to mess with my heating and cooling right in the car.

23:05.48
Jon
Mm-hmm.

23:05.52
Stan Lemon
I pull up a Honda display and I got to like hit a bunch of buttons to get back CarPlay and it doesn't dismiss, it doesn't restore like all this. so I bought a Subaru. That's, that's what I bought most recently. Again, I'm happy to talk about this in the future, but,

23:21.36
Stan Lemon
the Subaru has CarPlay in the middle of their own UI. And there are things that you can tap that actually pop up over top of CarPlay and then will dismiss.

23:32.50
Stan Lemon
And it's a much better experience. And the display is bigger too. And so now it's it's kind of funny. Like my my trajectory is like, I really want home or you know CarPlay, bought a car, had CarPlay.

23:44.02
Stan Lemon
Using CarPlay, I'm like, oh, this is actually a pretty disjointed experience. Got a different car. the experience it's not integrated, but it's like connected, if that makes any sense.

23:54.57
Jon
Sure.

23:54.82
Stan Lemon
And I'm kind of back to, I really like car play. Like it it just, it works. And I'm really glad don't have to log into 10,000 different things on the car.

24:02.61
Jon
You know, that was, that's like Apple's value proposition is it works. Didn't have to install drivers. Things just worked.

24:12.91
Jon
And now we're running in all these things that don't just work anymore.

24:16.72
Stan Lemon
Yeah, it's, it's, yes, I think so. I, the car story is a little different. So first of all, the it just works is like, I listen to my music. I listened to Libby, right?

24:29.71
Stan Lemon
There's no, there's no Libby app.

24:29.73
Jon
I don't

24:31.03
Stan Lemon
As far as I'm aware, that comes like on the main Subaru app store, the Honda app store, right? Like, i don't even think that's a thing. Um, But I'm able able little listen to Libby or listen to, you know, NFL premium plus radio, whatever it is while I'm, while I'm along for the ride, I can use Apple maps. I can use Google maps. I can use, you know, um, some other app. I don't know. Is MapQuest still a thing?

24:54.83
Jon
i know.

24:56.02
Stan Lemon
what Does MapQuest have an app? Anyhow, ah I can use Zoom to call in instead of my phone, right? Like all those things, those just work. They're driven off my phone. I got it. Cool. Great. Fantastic. But then the thing that's been weird to me about the car for the last two years is then going to do car stuff, like things that are legitimately car-centric. Even even like...

25:17.39
Stan Lemon
changing the balancing of the radio so that the kids don't have to hear it in the back. Like you got to hop out of CarPlay, you to go to this thing and then you hop back in. It feels very disjointed.

25:28.52
Stan Lemon
Subaru, it's it's still very much just, it's it's disjointed, but it's it feels less so because the way that they basically like, they've got their OS and they run CarPlay and just like a little window in the middle of the OS.

25:40.91
Stan Lemon
And it it works for me And I like it. I don't know, John. I wasn't expecting that. So i've I've come kind of the full gamut here. um i will say...

25:52.21
Jon
So this is basically like parallels on your car.

25:56.05
Stan Lemon
it's actually a great reference. That is a, that is a fantastic analogy.

25:59.47
Jon
OK.

26:00.21
Stan Lemon
No, no, i I really think that works. Um, because it is like just a little window. now it's reserved window. It's like a locked space. Like I can't you know move it around or minimize or whatever, but you know, I, today there's, there's controls at the bottom underneath CarPlay for HVAC. There's also some physical buttons for HVAC. They're all connected. They'll just work together, which is cool.

26:21.61
Jon
Hmm.

26:21.65
Stan Lemon
But, I can also then tap and get a much more bigger um like HVAC. It's not really HVAC, but like heating, cooling control and it'll pop up over top of the CarPlay and I can still see the CarPlay in the back.

26:35.19
Stan Lemon
Like I know it's still there, but then if I don't like after a couple seconds of not messing with it, it'll just dismiss its back on CarPlay. i don't have to like re-navigate.

26:42.23
Jon
Nice.

26:43.22
Stan Lemon
Yeah. And and i

26:44.11
Jon
Very important, you know, like when you're driving in traffic or driving at all, or when your 16-year-old is trying to drive.

26:47.06
Stan Lemon
it is, it is. The fact that I've had to like,

26:51.54
Stan Lemon
She better not be using the heads-up display. I got to figure how to lock that out. But um there's some other cool tech in this car too. There's actual facial recognition. Like it'll adjust my seat and my windows based upon recognizing my face.

27:04.22
Jon
cool.

27:04.95
Stan Lemon
Yeah, that's super cool. And that got me to thinking like, why in the heck does my Mac still not unlock on Face ID? You know?

27:14.42
Jon
Because it unlocks with your watch.

27:16.63
Stan Lemon
It unlocks with my watch. that's But how often does that work? that That's not super reliable.

27:21.67
Jon
Mine has been working pretty well. I haven't run into issues with it. I mean, it locks you out.

27:25.23
Stan Lemon
Pretty well.

27:26.38
Jon
What is it? Like every so many days, you have to type in your password again, which is still annoying in this day and age. But

27:32.85
Stan Lemon
if So I had that Windows laptop, right, that I bought in November. That has Face ID.

27:36.93
Jon
no.

27:38.90
Stan Lemon
It unlocks nearly instantaneously, and it does it every single time. Like, i think I think I've typed my password in it twice since I've had in November. Now, could be a security issue.

27:50.22
Stan Lemon
I don't know. But it's, some and there's some things like this that really annoy me. Like, I really just want those to just work.

28:02.12
Stan Lemon
But it does on the iPhone.

28:02.41
Jon
It does on the iPhone.

28:04.94
Stan Lemon
And it's mostly reliable on the iPad. why Why it's mostly reliable on the iPad, I don't know. Because the iPad's got a juicier chip. But, you know, this is what it is.

28:13.81
Jon
My iPad, I still have to use my fingerprint.

28:16.94
Stan Lemon
Oh, well, on the next one, Jonathan, on the next one, if if you ever upgrade, right?

28:20.37
Jon
on the next one. Like the iPad Air is still running super well for everything I use it for. Mm-hmm.

28:27.09
Stan Lemon
Yeah. I mean, I am the one I replaced with my current iPad was what do we determine five, six years old, which is old for me.

28:34.91
Jon
Yeah.

28:36.13
Stan Lemon
Like I replace everything all the time. Right. um And i kept it much longer than usual, but yeah. So what I will say is I think the technology in cars, this is an area where we could stand for some innovation. I'm not saying that Subaru is innovating, but it's at least more interesting than what Honda has done.

29:00.59
Stan Lemon
And ah it actually got me little excited. Like this car has actually gotten me excited about a car and driving, right?

29:07.23
Jon
Nice.

29:07.34
Stan Lemon
And and having tech in the in the car too. So, which is more than I can say for the HomePod. God help me if they ever put a HomePod in the, you know, in the car. That'd be awful.

29:17.23
Jon
You know, you have a place to stay in Iowa if you really want to put it through its paces.

29:21.55
Stan Lemon
yeah Noted, noted, noted, noted. All right, Jonathan. ah I guess, I guess that's, that's about an episode, eh?

29:32.51
Jon
That's an episode. I think it was a pretty good one.

29:33.88
Stan Lemon
right.

29:34.36
Jon
Maybe next time we'll be done with Julius Caesar and we can talk about that. All right, later.

29:37.97
Stan Lemon
Sounds like a plan. All right my friend, until next time.

29:41.18
Jon
Bye.
