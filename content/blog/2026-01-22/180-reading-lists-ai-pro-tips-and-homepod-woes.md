Dear Listener,

Stan and Jon open with winter weather and what they're reading right now, from Julius Caesar and Father Brown to Dante's Inferno, Narnia read-alouds, and a fresh Hunger Games installment. Along the way they compare favorite books, illustrated editions, and why some classics still hit harder with time.

They shift into AI workflows and share a simple pro tip: tell ChatGPT (or Claude, or Gemini) to ask you questions one at a time. That turns a vague prompt into a structured interview, which is especially handy for work and life planning. They also touch on Claude's new Co-Work approach, Apple leaning on Gemini, and the appeal of ChatGPT Health tied to Apple Health data.

The back half is a tech frustration parade: HomePod reliability slipping, Siri missing obvious intent, smart bulbs acting up after Thread/Matter changes, and AirPlay feeling worse than it used to. Stan closes with a new Subaru and a better CarPlay experience that finally feels integrated, plus the perennial gripe about Face ID still missing on Macs.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
