Dear Listener,

Stan and Jon kick things off with a winter weather check-in and cruise daydreaming. They map out Stan's upcoming Disney Treasure itinerary, from a St. Thomas catamaran sail and Tortola beach day to Castaway Cay bike rentals. That quickly turns into a food strategy session: Enchante brunch, Palo dinner debates, late-seating pacing, and the sacred cruise popcorn bucket.

Next up is a night out in Carmel: a Mack McAnally concert at the Palladium, a deeply Italian meal at Ristorante Roma, and Stan's full-on wine ritual, complete with cork inspection and tasting notes. The conversation then pivots to AI: Jon's pro tip is simple—don't ask a model to generate content cold; feed it your raw thoughts and use it as an editor. They wrestle with AI-as-search, junk data, and the surprisingly hard quest for a classy tissue-box riser.

The episode closes with glow-up prompts from the kids, a 2016 photo throwback, and a quick gripe about the iPhone Photos overhaul.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
