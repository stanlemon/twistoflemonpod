summary: >-
  Stan and Jon open with snowstorms and cruise anticipation, mapping out an
  Eastern Caribbean Disney Treasure trip, from St. Thomas catamaran plans to
  Castaway Cay bikes and a debate over Enchante vs. Palo bookings. They swap
  cruise food pro tips (popcorn buckets, Mickey bars, sweet shops) before a
  detour into a Mack McAnally concert, an Italian dinner in Carmel, and Stan's
  full wine-tasting ritual. An AI pro tip follows—don't ask models to generate
  content cold; feed them your material and use them as editors—along with
  concerns about junk data, search habits, and a hunt for the perfect tissue-box
  riser. The episode closes with glow-up prompts from the kids, 2016 photo
  nostalgia, and mild gripes about the iPhone Photos overhaul.

00:56.18
Stan Lemon
Well, Jonathan, how are you today?

00:58.58
Jon
I'm cold, Stanley. It's been cold for the past four days. it's gonna be cold for the next seven days.

01:05.78
Stan Lemon
Do you have snow?

01:07.51
Jon
ah There is snow on the ground, ah but we have avoided all the snow and ice storms. We've just got hit with the Arctic blast, as they call it.

01:15.96
Stan Lemon
So we're recording this as the snow is still coming down. So far, I have at least a foot that has graced us with its presence in the last...

01:20.99
Jon
Hmm.

01:26.09
Stan Lemon
24 hours, actually less than. um I love my snowblower, John. I love using it. Man, this is exhausting. This is a really tiring piece of equipment to use.

01:36.86
Jon
And this is the one that you've had, right? You haven't replaced the snowblower yet?

01:41.21
Stan Lemon
No, no, no. It's just a singles day. There's nothing fancy about it. And I've had it since, I guess, probably 2011, I think. i think is when I got it. So like it's it's been around a bit.

01:52.18
Stan Lemon
And I've used it at every home that we have owned since 2011. Yeah. a It serves me well. A two-stage would probably have been better for the foot of snow that we had, but this was fortunately light and very dry snow. So the the blower was able to pick it up and still throw it.

02:12.66
Stan Lemon
But man, is it a lot of snow. And here's the crazy thing. there, there've been no plows in the last 24 hours through my subdivision.

02:19.19
Jon
Don't know.

02:20.44
Stan Lemon
So when I shoveled, I shoveled up to the road and it looks like there is a foot of like a wall of a foot of snow, how a plow, cause they only bring the little pickup trucks through. How plows are going to move that? I do not know. Um,

02:34.97
Stan Lemon
It always amazes me how unprepared Indianapolis is for weather like this. But maybe shouldn't surprised after, seven years? i don't know, six years? i don't know how long I've been here, John. I've been here a while.

02:48.63
Jon
Eight years? Six years.

02:50.33
Stan Lemon
Is it that long?

02:52.70
Jon
Did you buy in 2018? Okay.

02:54.53
Stan Lemon
I did, John. I did. Wow. Wow. I've been here a long time. All right. Well, anyhow, that's how my day's going. Church was canceled because the roads are impassable.

03:06.43
Stan Lemon
I went last night. That's right. But no Sunday school to teach. So slept in. I've been reading. i went outside. i cleared snow. And now I'm talking to you, sipping a Chianti, wondering if I'm going to have a work offsite here in Indianapolis on Tuesday, as was planned, or if the weather will conspire to make that impossible.

03:20.77
Jon
Hmm.

03:24.14
Stan Lemon
Because if I can't drive into Indianapolis, it'd be kind of weird to have an offsite here.

03:27.38
Jon
People flying. Yeah.

03:28.65
Stan Lemon
Yeah. Um, but I'm sipping Chianti thinking about it's just a few more days and I will be on a cruise ship.

03:37.36
Jon
That's right. You're going someplace warm this time, right?

03:40.54
Stan Lemon
I am. Yes. Yeah. I've only done one cold weather cruise. It was Alaska. I did that one at the end of September and it was honestly not that cold. It wasn't short weather, but it wasn't that cold. So could not have asked for better way.

03:50.78
Jon
Yeah, you had beautiful weather from everything I've heard about Alaska cruising. So nice. Where are your ports of call, and do you have anything fun planned?

04:01.11
Stan Lemon
We do. And i you know what? Bringing it up, I should have expected you to ask. So I'm going to open up the app and tell you while we talk. But it is an Eastern Caribbean itinerary, which I have never done.

04:13.05
Jon
Nice.

04:14.03
Stan Lemon
So we will stop at the...

04:14.94
Jon
But I hear they are beautiful.

04:17.37
Stan Lemon
I mean, but listen, St. Thomas and Tortola, they look gorgeous. So I don't think I can go wrong. Those are the, those are two of the three ports. The third port is Castaway Cay, which is Disney's Island.

04:29.43
Stan Lemon
And, um, you know, we're, we always enjoy that. That, that never gets old. So looking forward to that, but yeah, here, let me I'm trying to find the, the list of things that we decided to do, John, because that's what you really want to know.

04:35.91
Jon
Yep.

04:43.62
Stan Lemon
Right.

04:44.40
Jon
Right.

04:45.35
Stan Lemon
Cause I like, i like, Oh,

04:45.54
Jon
There's some place with like a fort, right? I don't remember what island that is.

04:50.95
Stan Lemon
this does not ring a bell. Um, So at St. Thomas, we are doing a catamaran sail to Shipwreck Cove. Apparently, there'll be snorkeling too. I do not envision.

05:03.48
Stan Lemon
i will snorkel, but maybe. And then on Tortullis, we're doing a family beach escape to Jost van Dijk. So...

05:11.38
Jon
So relatively chill.

05:12.98
Stan Lemon
Relatively chill. Yeah. You know, we're going to do Castaway Cay. We always do the bike rental and then I'm going to get sea kayaks this time. I've never done sea kayaks.

05:20.34
Jon
Nice.

05:20.94
Stan Lemon
I want to sea kayaks. So, but ah just three ports on a seven night cruise.

05:23.08
Jon
That'll be fun.

05:27.90
Stan Lemon
This is on a wish class ship, which you have not been on a wish class ship. I have.

05:33.03
Jon
I have not.

05:33.31
Stan Lemon
Yeah.

05:33.88
Jon
You have.

05:34.04
Stan Lemon
But i think I think the experience was a little skewed. So I i last rode i rode on the Disney Wish in the concierge area.

05:37.56
Jon
Yes.

05:42.18
Stan Lemon
I got a deal, with people. right i got

05:43.38
Jon
And it was three nights, right?

05:44.82
Stan Lemon
It was three nights. I got a deal, and it was short, and and the weather was really bad.

05:45.62
Jon
Short course, yep.

05:48.98
Stan Lemon
And so we got tossed every which way, and we didn't stop in the Bahamas. Not that I was going to get off, but the boat was very busy in Nassau or around Nassau because couldn't get off.

06:00.09
Stan Lemon
But I've been on that size ship once. And because we were in concierge, we really didn't spend time in the broader area of the boat.

06:10.48
Jon
Hmm.

06:10.58
Stan Lemon
So like i i know I know what it's like like. I toured it. I made sure I tried all the new pool deck food, all the good stuff. But I didn't like live in it like I'm going to on this trip.

06:21.37
Stan Lemon
So I'm looking forward to it.

06:21.69
Jon
Correct.

06:24.38
Jon
Well, that should be fun. You're on the Treasure, right?

06:25.52
Stan Lemon
yeah On the treasure. Yep.

06:27.64
Jon
The Treasure is the theming that most interests me on the Wish Class reps.

06:27.79
Stan Lemon
Yep.

06:33.50
Stan Lemon
Okay, tell me more, John. because i haven't So this is the thing. I go and experience the boat. You watch lots of YouTube on the boat, and I learn what I should look for by talking to you.

06:43.42
Jon
So the treasure is all like adventure themed. um So like the ship statue and the whatever they call it on Wish Class, it's not atrium, it's like Grand Ballroom or something like that, right?

06:56.18
Jon
I don't remember.

06:56.25
Stan Lemon
um i Again, you might know better than I don't i don't recall this particular detail.

07:00.76
Jon
Well, the statue. Each cruise ship has a statue in in the main space when you enter the ship.

07:02.41
Stan Lemon
Yeah. The statue. Yeah.

07:06.61
Jon
This is um Aladdin, Jasmine, and the Magic Carpet. um So my favorite Disney IP.

07:11.54
Stan Lemon
Oh, cool. Why um hey am i thinking that T'Challa was in the Disney Wish?

07:19.73
Jon
That's the Destiny.

07:21.36
Stan Lemon
Is that the Destiny?

07:22.49
Jon
Yeah, not the Wish.

07:22.97
Stan Lemon
What did the Disney Wish...

07:24.54
Jon
The Wish is... um

07:27.38
Jon
Why do I not know? I should know.

07:30.04
Stan Lemon
The animated movie wishes a fantasy fair to celebrate. Oh, that's about the movie. I can't for the life me remember what the Disney.

07:36.26
Jon
Cinderella, of course.

07:37.49
Stan Lemon
Oh my gosh. All right. That's embarrassing.

07:41.14
Jon
That's right, because there's like this little detail where the Gus Gus and the other mouse is like under the back of the dress or something like that.

07:46.19
Stan Lemon
Yeah.

07:49.23
Stan Lemon
Okay, this is coming back to me a little bit. um that was So here's what I'll say. That central atrium feels smaller to me on The Wish than it does on The Dream of the Fantasy.

07:59.52
Stan Lemon
It probably is bigger, but it felt smaller.

08:01.77
Jon
Right. Mm-hmm.

08:03.18
Stan Lemon
And as such, we didn't spend a lot of time in the atrium at all just because it felt so crowded. The the orientation of this boat, the the way that the like bar space is in the backside of it,

08:15.37
Stan Lemon
It was the backside of it. Maybe it's the front. And the main bar spries bar space is like more open and terraced. And so I suspect that they probably freed up some space for it, but you know, we'll, we'll I'll take better notes of time.

08:28.43
Jon
So the bars on the treasure, you've got a Haunted Mansion themed one, which apparently is always busy, not overly big, but the theming is super, super cool. um Then you've got the Skipper Society Lounge, um so like Jungle Cruise themed.

08:36.98
Stan Lemon
Okay.

08:42.93
Jon
um And then there's a Scat Cat Lounge, which I imagine is where you're going to hang out. I think that's the one that's kind of in the open.

08:51.02
Stan Lemon
Oh, why do you think I'll hang out at the scat cat?

08:53.74
Jon
I mean, just sounds most up your alley out of the three. Maybe the Skipper Society, because you have some pretty bad jokes too.

08:58.40
Stan Lemon
I'm so fascinated, Jonathan, why you why you think this to be true?

09:02.29
Jon
Well, because they're going to have live music, I assume, and i don't know. It just seems like it seems like the Lemon way of life.

09:11.76
Stan Lemon
Okay. All right. I was waiting for the live music cue because that is absolutely my jam. So I think on cruising, when I can find a decent bar with a sommelier bin and live music, I'm all in. And that's why to this day, the wonder on the Alaska cruise is my favorite part.

09:31.09
Stan Lemon
cruise that I've had because the bar there is very much open and ah the live music was fantastic. But I think that openness too really amplifies it.

09:42.00
Stan Lemon
You just get more people moving around. There's more to see. you You don't have to like whisper. I don't know. Like I enjoy that. And I think because it's open too, more people are inclined to come and sit down and listen to the music and participate.

09:54.64
Jon
Right.

09:54.70
Stan Lemon
So

09:54.88
Jon
And it's more inviting than like the Bon Voyage bar that we have occasionally imbibed at.

10:00.53
Stan Lemon
Yeah. And Bon Voyage is great. Don't get me wrong. But when you think about like the atmosphere in Bon Voyage, when there's been music versus like the district, right. um On the dream and the district, you've just got people coming and going, especially during certain times.

10:15.87
Stan Lemon
Right. And and when the live music is going, people will pass through and then just stay there.

10:17.07
Jon
No.

10:21.02
Stan Lemon
And so I like that part of it. I just, I really do. yeah, I think, you know, the wonder we would go and camp out like an hour and a half before dinner and listen to music and have a glass of wine and whatnot. And then just get in line for dinner because it was, you know, half the time it was right there. Right.

10:40.62
Stan Lemon
And I enjoy that. So I'm curious to see the dynamic on this one. The restaurants, ah do you know, are they the same as on the wish?

10:49.07
Jon
ah I think that the one is Miguel themed, Coco themed?

10:56.17
Stan Lemon
Oh, that'd be cool. the kids will like that.

10:58.86
Jon
Treasure Restaurant.

10:59.36
Stan Lemon
It's like a lot.

11:01.90
Jon
Do you have Enchante booked at all?

11:04.85
Stan Lemon
I have on, yeah. So actually this is funny. Um,

11:09.42
Stan Lemon
we've been trying to decide what to do. So we have had a Enchante brunch. That's the French restaurant for those that don't know on like the, it's a restaurant that you pay extra to go to rather than than sit down. we We had brunch on the wish and it is to this day, the best extra paid meal I've had on a Disney cruise ship.

11:26.22
Stan Lemon
Right.

11:26.32
Jon
Which is saying a lot because like all of the adult-only upcharge dining is fantastic.

11:26.53
Stan Lemon
Like,

11:33.02
Stan Lemon
It's all fantastic. Yes.

11:34.03
Jon
oh

11:34.45
Stan Lemon
The, the brunch Enchante was like maybe the best meal I've ever had ever. Like, like it was it was literally at that level. Like I'm, I'm sitting here trying to think to you think for you rather, uh, when, when I had a meal that was better and I can't, I cannot come up with it.

11:52.22
Stan Lemon
It was just so fantastic. And I've had some really nice meals, you know?

11:56.34
Jon
have

11:56.70
Stan Lemon
Yeah. Uh,

11:58.42
Jon
on land and sea. So,

11:59.86
Stan Lemon
Yeah, one thing I'm not afraid to spend money on is food, right? So so we have Enchante brunch booked again. We have Enchante dinner booked. And then because I was like a drunken sailor booking stuff, right? Because you do this at midnight and you're just like, you you know you can't.

12:13.20
Stan Lemon
Part of the problem that I have when i'm booking is I'm like, i don't I can't remember what I booked, what I didn't book. I can i don't have like a list of the schedule. And so all I'll just book everything I got, everything I can, and then I'll sort it out afterwards. Yeah. So I've got those two booked. And then I also have Palo booked for dinner the night that we have Enchante for brunch.

12:34.10
Stan Lemon
And I was trying to remember, it's a lot of food.

12:34.57
Jon
That's a lot of food.

12:36.46
Stan Lemon
It's a lot of food, especially because it's frigging Palo. Like, they you know, their portions are humongous.

12:41.05
Jon
Paulo. Paulo.

12:41.99
Stan Lemon
Palo, sorry, Palo, Palo. And I should know that because I think I might cut the Palo. Like there's a strong possibility to cut the Palo. We'll see. But yeah,

12:53.36
Stan Lemon
ah yeah But with the thing i've been struggling I don't know that I've Palo for dinner. I've had Palo brunch.

13:00.11
Jon
So you know ah what is your favorite dessert at sea?

13:00.22
Stan Lemon
I've had…

13:05.42
Stan Lemon
Oh, um souffle.

13:07.95
Jon
The souffle in whatever restaurant is being served at just in the rotational dining. Paulo Dinner also has souffle on the dessert menu.

13:16.73
Stan Lemon
Oh, you're killing me.

13:19.42
Jon
I've not had it, but everything I hear about it, um it could be the best dessert you'll ever have. You know what you should do You should book Paulo on night one because like that hardly ever fills up.

13:31.95
Jon
um And then go from there.

13:33.46
Stan Lemon
I don't, I, well, so, okay. All right. The problem with that is like you meet your waiters and waitresses and like all that, right?

13:38.17
Jon
Right.

13:39.34
Stan Lemon
Like it's not, I don't know. I'll, I'll look. I, I would hate to do them on the same day. We'll get on the boat.

13:46.64
Jon
You do have seven nights.

13:47.35
Stan Lemon
we I do have seven nights. Maybe they like they can reshuffle them. But yeah, it's still, and that's, you're right. It's open. I'm looking at it right now. Palo is open on the first night, which is crazy to me.

13:59.19
Stan Lemon
I should check the other days.

14:00.14
Jon
Because everybody wants to meet their servers. so

14:02.54
Stan Lemon
Everybody wants to meet their servers, right? And and weve we have done, it's super chaotic, yeah.

14:04.75
Jon
And like the first day is always kind of chaotic.

14:09.62
Stan Lemon
But, oh, Jonathan, the Castaway Cay Day has Palo Steakhouse Dinner available. it ah At least it looks like it is. Is that is that believable? Maybe I should do this.

14:19.28
Jon
That is believable.

14:19.61
Stan Lemon
Should do this live on the podcast?

14:21.62
Jon
There you go.

14:24.56
Stan Lemon
Oh, due to the popularity this experience,

14:24.62
Jon
I think when you get back, we need to talk about Disney Cruise Tech because I think it leaves a lot to be desired.

14:29.33
Stan Lemon
Oh, this leaves so much to be desired. So I have to cancel my other reservation to get one on the last night. Do I do that before I go? I, that's definitely, I got a consult with Mrs.

14:38.20
Jon
know.

14:39.82
Stan Lemon
Lemon in real time kind of thing, but so, okay.

14:41.92
Jon
Yeah.

14:42.49
Stan Lemon
So I booked all these things, right? And I didn't, as a general rule, I don't book a fancy dinner on a night that we are in port. Um, now I need to revisit that heuristic because we're doing late dinner, which I will probably do late dinner from now on, to be completely honest with you.

15:02.67
Jon
Really? Because we did it the first time and you hated it.

15:03.13
Stan Lemon
And,

15:05.50
Stan Lemon
I did hate it. I did hate it. So, okay, here's here's the thing. If you're going to do late dinner, you have to strategize your day around it, right? And yeah, like you've got to strategize breakfast.

15:14.83
Jon
You just have to strategize when you're going to eat around it.

15:19.57
Stan Lemon
You got to strategize lunch. You got to make sure you're satiated because you're sitting down for dinner.

15:21.71
Jon
ah

15:23.55
Stan Lemon
What, like eight o'clock, maybe 740th and

15:24.82
Jon
I think that you get very you get very confused about this because there's literally ah food on the cruise ship pretty much all day.

15:35.95
Stan Lemon
No, no, I know, but it's like it's it's about pacing myself, Jonathan.

15:39.29
Jon
Okay.

15:40.17
Stan Lemon
It's about pacing myself and making sure that like the the worst thing that can happen is that we're going have a fantastic dinner and two hours before I gorge myself right because then I won't have any room for dinner.

15:50.19
Jon
right.

15:52.24
Stan Lemon
And so it's all about pacing and strategy. right This is like a game of chess with between me and my gastrointestinal system. Right?

16:00.85
Jon
So like on the ah dream and fantasy, there's like this lighter pool food that I think I've stopped at once with like salads and sandwiches and stuff.

16:10.38
Stan Lemon
yeah yeah That's great.

16:11.28
Jon
So like that would be a good pre-dinner snack.

16:11.46
Stan Lemon
yeah

16:14.35
Stan Lemon
It could be. Yes. Although i don't know that that's, is that always open? I don't, I think the closer you get to dinner, cause here's here's the other, here's the challenge, right? When first dinner starts, I think some of that stuff closes on the dream class stuff.

16:26.10
Stan Lemon
um I could be misremembering, but I think that's true. So again, like you're, you're, you're balancing, you're strategizing. and One of my favorite things to do is to walk into the Cove Cafe and get their salty snacks that come out after five o'clock and

16:37.42
Jon
me

16:39.06
Stan Lemon
Yeah, you know, get like a olive tapenade and, you know, who knows what else. So, charcuterie, yeah, they got some charcuterie too.

16:45.98
Jon
Charcuterie, basically.

16:49.64
Stan Lemon
it's It's just yeah some stuff that's like fatty but not overwhelming, right? Or, know, if I could find some fava beans at a bar.

16:54.96
Jon
Yep. And you could have your afternoon coffee there, too.

17:00.91
Stan Lemon
have my afternoon coffee? I also could just go back to the room and do um room service and get a hamburger, right?

17:08.83
Jon
Yep, you could do that.

17:09.87
Stan Lemon
but Or wings.

17:10.03
Jon
so

17:10.75
Stan Lemon
I could get wings. Or you go to the pub and you get wings there. Now, those wings cost extra, but the wings at the pub are fantastic. They are like next level good.

17:19.63
Jon
And like yes, you have to pay for them on top of your cruise fare, but it was pretty affordable as far as wings go.

17:26.93
Stan Lemon
Yeah.

17:27.58
Jon
so

17:27.98
Stan Lemon
Yeah. As far as wings go, it was totally reasonable. I think we've been on a couple of cruises where we've had to watch ah a football game.

17:34.90
Jon
Had to.

17:34.96
Stan Lemon
That will not be the case on this one. And so, um,

17:36.56
Jon
Correct.

17:38.22
Stan Lemon
it is not uncommon for us to go camp out at the at the bar, at the at the pub, right? and get a good seat for the game, order wings and popcorn from the movie theater and and who knows what else, right?

17:50.80
Stan Lemon
Like all that, but which by the way, here's here's a cruise pro tip.

17:51.40
Jon
Yep. Yep.

17:54.68
Stan Lemon
When you get on the boat, go buy the refillable container for popcorn. from the movie theater, because first of all, like it's fantastic. Like it's it's really good, but you just refill it for like a buck, right?

18:06.35
Stan Lemon
And so we do this and then it's in the room and the kids are just constantly, like if they're hungry, like, oh, I'm gonna have some popcorn, you know? Or I wanna sit out on the balcony and watch, you know, the waves go by.

18:17.04
Stan Lemon
I can have some popcorn. So yeah.

18:19.28
Jon
I like it. I've never gotten popcorn on a cruise ship, but I don't love popcorn that much.

18:24.00
Stan Lemon
Oh, I love popcorn. In fact, when I'm done with this recording, I'm gonna go have some of Mrs. Lemon's popcorn, which is fantastic.

18:28.72
Jon
Mrs. Lemon's popcorn is fantastic.

18:30.99
Stan Lemon
Yeah, yeah. So, and i have ah I have a, I don't know, I've got a soft spot for the type of pop, like it's, it's I don't know how to describe this other than when you go into a car dealership, they've got the little popcorn machine, you get the little bags, right?

18:45.74
Jon
You've been in a car dealership more than I have.

18:46.09
Stan Lemon
No. Okay, all right. Well, so that's that's the type of popcorn we're talking about on the cruise ship. Sometimes you get it at like a a carnival or a fair, right?

18:57.20
Jon
Sure.

18:57.36
Stan Lemon
That same kind of thing, right? So way too much salt. Like it's it's all of America's daily sodium needs in like one shot, but it is so tasty.

19:05.34
Jon
Yep.

19:08.04
Stan Lemon
And I'm just, i don't know, like I like having it around, like having it available. So that is what it is.

19:14.69
Jon
All right.

19:15.38
Stan Lemon
But I was going to ask you, do you know what the the sweet treat spot is? Because it's not Penelope's and it's not whatever, like where are the gelatos?

19:21.47
Jon
Ooh, on the treasure, I don't. But that seems like an easy thing to search.

19:23.63
Stan Lemon
Yeah.

19:26.32
Stan Lemon
i couldn't I couldn't remember what what it was called. I think Penelope's was what it was called on.

19:30.29
Jon
Oh, isn't it? um Or maybe that's the Wish, but one of them's Inside Out themed.

19:35.31
Stan Lemon
Yeah, yeah. The wish is inside out. That's what it is. Penelope's is what, the dream? It looks like maybe Jumbo's Sweets. Does that sound right?

19:40.84
Jon
Jumbo Sweets, yep.

19:42.48
Stan Lemon
Which is ah Zootopia reference.

19:43.38
Jon
Zootopia?

19:44.64
Stan Lemon
have Have you seen Zootopia 2? Do I?

19:46.86
Jon
I have not, and I've only seen Zootopia once, I believe.

19:51.60
Stan Lemon
I wonder if I need to watch Zootopia 2 before I get on this boat, if there's Zootopia-themed stuff.

19:56.14
Jon
Might be playing on the boat stand.

19:58.84
Stan Lemon
Oh, that'd be good. So I... It is, i I have had from the snack shop, like the sweet snack shop, like something once. I think I got i got gelato once on the dream, I think, right? I don't like, ah not a last impression.

20:14.77
Stan Lemon
One of my goals this trip is to have a sweet treat in that space and have it be memorable. That the last day last part's key, right? Have it be memorable. So, I don't

20:23.25
Jon
All right. Well, best luck to you. When in doubt, um you don't pay extra for the premium Mickey bars from Room Service.

20:32.69
Stan Lemon
And as you recently learned, right, the Mickey bars are, they're just fantastic.

20:36.99
Jon
They're fantastic.

20:37.87
Stan Lemon
Yeah, yeah.

20:38.56
Jon
Like, you don't expect that kind of ice cream thing to be fantastic, but it really is.

20:44.75
Stan Lemon
Yeah, there's it's, i don't know, man. There's a perfect balance between, it's it's like soft serve vanilla ice cream, but it's a little thicker, right? It's a little colder.

20:53.10
Jon
And it has flavor.

20:54.41
Stan Lemon
It has flavor, yeah. And then it's got this like perfect chocolate crunch to the outside, but it's not, I don't know. It's not like nauseating dove milk chocolate, right?

21:04.50
Jon
Right. It's like very, very good chocolate.

21:07.26
Stan Lemon
It's very good chocolate, right? and the simplicity of it, the balance of it, the coldness of it when you're in the Caribbean like or you know California or Florida, wherever you're at. like I think the Mickey bar is one of the hidden gems of Disney, to be completely honest with you.

21:23.44
Jon
Well, I am now sold on that, and I was a skeptic before my trip to Disneyland.

21:28.40
Stan Lemon
Which is so funny because you literally, every time you've been on a cruise ship with my kids, you're like, go get Mickey bar. Go get a Mickey bar.

21:33.98
Jon
Right.

21:34.70
Stan Lemon
Go get a Mickey bar. And I realize now, like like some of your guidance that i've I've picked up on over the years.

21:40.39
Jon
I've not actually followed.

21:41.46
Stan Lemon
yeah Yeah, you've never done it. It's hollow guidance, right? It doesn't mean it's bad guidance, just to be clear. it's just hollow guidance. So, yeah, I don't feel it.

21:46.93
Jon
Uninformed? No, it's informed. It's just not unexperienced.

21:50.54
Stan Lemon
Inexperienced, yeah. Now, i i this is what i appreciate about you, Jonathan, because I am generally unwilling to recommend something I haven't tried myself. And you you're just like, hey, I read i read you know two blog posts and watched 18 YouTube videos, and they all said go for the Mickey part.

22:05.97
Jon
So I think what it comes down to is i understand that not everyone has the same tastes as me, but I feel like I can also recommend to someone else's tastes.

22:17.62
Stan Lemon
Okay. And this is this is like a fundamental difference you and I have philosophically about life, right?

22:21.07
Jon
Right.

22:22.51
Stan Lemon
Because I believe that my tastes are are the absolute truth in the universe, right? On this astral plane, basically I'm right. And if people disagree, then there's something either wrong with their taste buds, their nose, their brain, or maybe even the very essence of their soul, right?

22:40.90
Stan Lemon
Right.

22:41.97
Jon
And as you are sitting here drinking a glass of wine, i think I've found a way to navigate that as well.

22:48.35
Stan Lemon
Oh, yeah? um Tell me more. Tell me more.

22:50.74
Jon
Like when your go-to was like Yellow Tail Shiraz um for wine. So...

22:57.94
Stan Lemon
Oh, yeah. Well, I've come a long way, I do think. can i tell Can I tell you a funny story about wine? so this this is i've I've gone too far, as I'm as i'm prone to do, right?

23:07.07
Jon
Yes.

23:07.82
Stan Lemon
I think...

23:08.02
Jon
In everything you do.

23:09.24
Stan Lemon
In everything I do. So on Friday night, I bought tickets to a Mac McNally concert for Mrs. Lemon and I at this place called the Palladium in Carmel, which is the most amazing building. I mean, like the building itself is just breathtaking. The sound in the building is next level phenomenal. ah This is the second concert i've been to. The first concert was a guitarist that no one know the name of, but he was he was fantastic.

23:33.42
Stan Lemon
And I've had this sense as I'm walking in that... I'm like 20 years too young for the crowd that shows up. Right.

23:41.06
Jon
Yep.

23:41.74
Stan Lemon
But that's okay. Like I can live with that.

23:43.18
Jon
You've run into that several times.

23:45.02
Stan Lemon
I've run that in several times. $10 valet. Like, you know, you this, this is, feels like a steal for those that don't know who Mack McNally is.

23:51.57
Jon
did you Did you tip the valet well?

23:54.03
Stan Lemon
I did. Yeah, of course it was cold, man.

23:54.70
Jon
Okay.

23:55.59
Stan Lemon
It was like, it was like five degrees out. I did them real well. Um, so, uh, I sent you, I think I sent you a video. Did you, were you familiar with Mack McNally before this?

24:04.88
Jon
I was not until you explained who it was.

24:06.93
Stan Lemon
Okay. All right. So Mac McNally was in the band, the Coral Reefers, which was Jimmy Buffett's band. Mac McNally though, uh, is a songwriter. He's a singer songwriter. So he wrote songs for Buffett. He also wrote songs for Kenny Chesney. He's written songs for a bunch of people, right?

24:24.88
Stan Lemon
Um, The Kenny Chesney song you might know is Down the Road. i think I think on the recording, he actually sings with Kenny Chesney. But that one, like that was like a Billboard Top 10 or something like that. That was a crazy famous song.

24:35.86
Stan Lemon
um He wrote one of my favorite songs, which I did not realize. i had There were two songs by Mack McNally that I wanted to hear. He didn't play either of them. um But one of my favorite Jimmy Buffett songs is It's My Job, which is a great vocational song.

24:52.82
Stan Lemon
And... um Turns out he wrote that. So he performed it. And this is crazy to me. He was doing like road construction, like asphalt lane when he wrote this song.

25:04.11
Jon
Nice.

25:04.66
Stan Lemon
Yeah. Which is even cooler. Like it's a, it's a really fantastic song.

25:06.53
Jon
Yep.

25:08.74
Stan Lemon
I probably listened to this song once a week, like no joke. Okay.

25:12.98
Jon
I believe that.

25:13.74
Stan Lemon
um Cause there's, don't know, there's something inspiring to it. Right. I, John, I just love that song.

25:17.85
Jon
Right. Keeps you waking up to go to work, right?

25:19.38
Stan Lemon
Okay.

25:20.38
Jon
see

25:20.85
Stan Lemon
Yeah, well, exactly, right? hi Honestly, i feel like I feel like it's a manifestation of the way that I view a job and work, right?

25:28.35
Jon
Right.

25:29.78
Stan Lemon
Which which is really just...

25:30.10
Jon
Where you would much rather be, you know, hanging out, having your cheeseburger in paradise.

25:33.97
Stan Lemon
Yes, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And and you know all of this is just ultimately a riff on Dr. Martin Luther's theology of vocation, but you know I don't even know that Mac McNally, Southern Baptist from Mississippi knows that, but hey, like that's that's where's that's the root. Okay, so we we're going to this concert. Mac McNally, the two songs, by the way, before i forget, that he didn't play that I love that he wrote. One is Oysters and Pearls. Are you familiar this song? Yeah, yeah,

26:01.30
Stan Lemon
Yep. So he wrote that one. i that's a That's another just like fantastic and inspiring song. And the other one is Once in a Lifetime, which is another just like... uplifting country folk song um that as far as I know, he's the only one that performs it.

26:15.38
Stan Lemon
You should listen when we're done. Cause it's, I have, I have a set of songs that are like, I'm just going to have a good day.

26:16.97
Jon
All right.

26:20.10
Stan Lemon
This is a happy day playlist. And once a lifetime is on there. um And.

26:25.20
Jon
I feel like your list is very different from my list that I use for the same thing.

26:25.42
Stan Lemon
and

26:29.63
Stan Lemon
well it could be, could be what you like Katy Perry roar or something. No, that's okay. That's on my list too. Along with Mac McNally. So before this concert, we're like, all right, let's go let's go get some food. So we went to this place called Ristorante Roma in Carmel.

26:47.28
Stan Lemon
And I had, I'm going say this around the pappardelle, right? So like a ah pasta, cream sauce, and sausage dish. Yeah.

26:56.25
Jon
delicious

26:57.30
Stan Lemon
Oh, it it was it it had so much umami flavor from mushrooms like in it. without i don't If there was a piece of mushroom in it, I didn't notice it.

27:06.97
Jon
Nice.

27:07.22
Stan Lemon
um But just like that nice, almost truffly taste to it. And the sauce was so layered. It was it like it was just absolutely fantastic. And the waiter who served that part of the meal, very good.

27:19.15
Stan Lemon
um When we got to the restaurant, here's here's what I'll say too. Here's a spoiler alert, right? So that waiter, that waitress, she was delightful. But in general, I would say that this is the most authentic Italian meal that I have experienced since I was in Italy, right?

27:35.31
Stan Lemon
And what I mean by that is like the food resembled food in Italy. The portions, which is, this is a big thing, right? The portions resembled portions in Italy because Italian American Italian American food, the portions are like,

27:49.05
Stan Lemon
10x, right?

27:49.81
Jon
outrageous.

27:50.00
Stan Lemon
And like it's too much.

27:50.15
Jon
Yeah.

27:51.60
Stan Lemon
It's too much. And so all the pasta was homemade. like The food was was just solid, like really solid. And the service was equally as disappointing as service you would find in a restaurant Rome, right?

28:05.10
Stan Lemon
ah which Which, by the way, if you're like, okay, so is that a good thing a bad thing? here's Here's what I've come to figure about ah people in Rome, Roman people. Their food is so good, they do not have to compensate for the food with their service.

28:19.73
Stan Lemon
And so, like like many Europeans, they just don't care, right? And ah it's all right.

28:23.79
Jon
Right.

28:25.68
Stan Lemon
They can pull it off. I'm not really sure that Carmel can pull it off, but the Roman restaurante experience in general was very Roman, all right? um I would recommend going back there. I would go back there again. But here's the deal. So I go up to the bar because we get there a little early.

28:41.90
Stan Lemon
And by the way, 630 reservation in America means 630, not 650 Roma Ristorante, but who's counting, right? um So fantastic menu of Italian wines. Like, again, reminds me of looking at a menu in um in Italy, right?

29:03.89
Stan Lemon
So... I start flipping through and I know the regions now, right? So I can navigate the regions. And I'm um'm like, I'm getting a little excited. I find some wines from Piedmont, right?

29:16.59
Jon
I

29:17.52
Stan Lemon
And I have a soft spot for Piedmontese wines because of a fantastic meal with a terrible waiter that we had a fantastic conversation with, right? ah

29:29.00
Jon
bet you got him to warm up to you, right?

29:29.14
Stan Lemon
And i did We did, yeah. Yeah, after i insulted him with my horrible Italian. um but But, you know, like, this is, it's the little things that count in life, John. But when I'm looking at a menu of Italian wines, and they actually label them D-O-C-G, DOCG, right?

29:50.60
Stan Lemon
I'm like, ooh. this place takes it serious, right? Because um I'm going to botch this, but ah what is it? Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita.

30:01.78
Jon
I have no idea how to pronounce it, but it's basically the governing body of winemaking in that region.

30:08.02
Stan Lemon
Yes, yeah. And so if if you're if you're if it says Doc G, and a lot of times they'll just say it on the, there's like a little band at the top of the the foil, right?

30:17.84
Jon
Mm-hmm.

30:18.59
Stan Lemon
You'll see Doc G kind of in, well, the yeah, sorry, the bottom of the foil, foil being at the top of the bottle, yeah.

30:19.49
Jon
At the bottom of the foil. But...

30:23.77
Jon
Yeah, top to the bottom, yeah.

30:25.36
Stan Lemon
All squished, right? So, okay. So first of all, I see this, I'm like, oh, the... These guys have come out to play, right? So I find this Barbarossa wine, and I order it.

30:38.83
Stan Lemon
And the guy comes out, and he slices the foil, takes it off, uncorks it, shows me the bottle. He does everything, i would say, mostly correct, right, in terms of the the pageantry that's involved.

30:51.04
Jon
I

30:53.01
Stan Lemon
It was a Fanta Bianca. And I reached for the cork as my friend Jonathan has taught me to do. And I looked at it.

31:02.06
Jon
and don't know if I've taught you this part, but...

31:03.34
Stan Lemon
No, you absolutely did.

31:04.13
Jon
okay.

31:04.18
Stan Lemon
You absolutely, you me this on a cruise. You me this on a cruise. So, um and the thing is like when you when you gesture for the cork, he's supposed to hold the bottle so that you can see the label in a way to verify that what's on the cork matches the bottle, right?

31:17.54
Jon
Mesh is lot of water.

31:18.31
Stan Lemon
Like there's a very there's a very specific piece of the pattern tree where he holds it up so you can look at it. and i And I did the thing, i might at this point, Mrs. Lump is like, oh my gosh, what's going on? And so he pours the quirk.

31:29.90
Jon
and The reason you do that is because there's a lot of counterfeit wine. um so like you The easy way to tell that is if the cork doesn't match what's on the label.

31:38.69
Stan Lemon
The quirk doesn't match, yeah. Which has never happened to me, Jonathan. And I don't believe that I buy bottles expensive enough that people are frauding them, just to be clear, right?

31:41.87
Jon
Me neither.

31:46.03
Jon
hopeful true

31:47.15
Stan Lemon
But, but like there's the pageantry of this is so fun. And, and he knew what to do, which is cool too. Right. And, uh, so he pours a little into the glass. I hold it up to the light. i hold it up over.

32:01.17
Stan Lemon
um I took a piece of paper that I saw his side of my, go too far.

32:04.02
Jon
but This is the part where you go too far, I think, Stan.

32:06.93
Stan Lemon
so What's funny is, is I,

32:07.28
Jon
like You're just supposed to be able to smell it and see if the bottle's corked or not.

32:12.27
Stan Lemon
So oh I reach for the piece of paper, right?

32:12.34
Jon
ah

32:15.49
Stan Lemon
And Mrs. Lemon goes, Stan, the countertop is literally white. Okay. But I go through the motions and take sniff and then I swirl it. I take another sip sniff.

32:27.76
Stan Lemon
I rattle off the things that that I detected before, all of this. And at this point, Mrs. Lemon is just shaking her head. I take us a little sip and I let it run all over the mouth, do the...

32:39.08
Stan Lemon
Slurp kind of thing. Right. And I then, you know, swallow and I proceed to explain to exactly what I had. and he And he goes, like he's waiting, right. For me to basically say that I want to have this bottle. And I made him wait.

32:49.78
Stan Lemon
Like, cause I was thinking about it. Right.

32:51.75
Jon
All right. For you people who order or wine, there are two things at that moment where they small pour a small taste is for.

32:56.89
Stan Lemon
Yeah.

32:58.74
Jon
One, is the bottle corked or not? Does it smell like wet cardboard or swamp or something like that? And at that point, you say, you know, this tastes a little off. Would you taste and let me know?

33:11.98
Jon
Second one is that is the point where you can ask if you want to decant it or not.

33:18.06
Stan Lemon
Ah, well, I should have done that. I should have done. Okay. All right.

33:20.08
Jon
And at this place, it sounds like they might be able to pull it off.

33:20.38
Stan Lemon
well

33:22.32
Jon
There's a lot of places that want to get a model of one.

33:23.44
Stan Lemon
they had They actually had the most beautiful decanting rack I've ever seen in my life.

33:27.09
Jon
Nice.

33:28.20
Stan Lemon
Like a legit decanting rack. Right. So I should have asked that. I should have asked that. But at this point, I looked at him and said, that'll do. Right.

33:36.85
Jon
He's probably complaining about you on social media when he got home that night.

33:37.23
Stan Lemon
And it was it was honestly... Oh, I'm sure. i'm sure. Yeah. Well, and here's the crazy thing. Like he took so frigging long to get me my bill after they gave me my seat so that Mrs. Lemon goes, like starts eating bread, goes to the bathroom, dry has a glass of water.

33:54.55
Stan Lemon
And then he brings me my check so that I can go and have dinner with my wife. So yeah, I was, i was a little annoyed.

33:58.90
Jon
Yeah.

34:00.50
Stan Lemon
So yeah. Very tiny.

34:03.05
Jon
Nice. Yep.

34:03.66
Stan Lemon
But it was a really good really good meal. like I genuinely and enjoyed it. And I will go back despite maybe the subpar service. So you know wola we'll see. We'll see. But the Mac McDonnelly concert was phenomenal. And one of the weirdest things is he played he played the song, I Heard It From The Great Pine.

34:25.17
Stan Lemon
yeah And he was sitting at the piano with a guitar on his lap, switching between instruments. okay

34:33.75
Jon
That's a special kind of skill.

34:35.14
Stan Lemon
It's a special kind skill. And his rendition of the the whole thing was... ah Like he was just showing up musical talent. His drummer, as far as I could tell, did not have a normal set of Tom Toms. Also the the drummer from the Coral Reefer band had all kinds of things to make sound dangling all around him.

34:57.39
Stan Lemon
um It was, it was really quite the spectacle and and enjoyed it. I was, Sarah and I were, that's my wife, we were reflecting a little bit on, cause he would tell a story, and they'd play a song, tell story, play song. And he would tell a story about like something or actually have a Jimmy Buffett before they wrote this song.

35:11.09
Stan Lemon
And I don't remember exactly which story this was, but it was Jimmy Buffett was writing his first book. He was holed up in a cabin in Georgia, and he calls up Mac MacDonald. He's like, hey, come. I've been staring at pros so long, I want to write some music.

35:25.55
Stan Lemon
And is they sit down. Oh, maybe it was – no, wasn't Volcano. He played Volcano too. That was pretty amazing. um So apparently Jimmy's like, just come up with a lick in Indy.

35:37.87
Stan Lemon
Right. Right. And I'm thinking to myself, like, so well first of all, the the musical skill to just, like, respond to that on the fly, but also, like, the amount of camaraderie that has to exist between two musicians who are going to sit down and write a song. They're basically writing poetry together and throwing music in the mix.

35:58.26
Stan Lemon
Right. i and And to just just be able to have that dialogue and then off to the races. and Like, it just blows my mind. Blows my mind.

36:06.00
Jon
That's awesome.

36:07.04
Stan Lemon
Yeah. So you should come and hang out with me. We'll go to the Palladium. We'll take the we'll take the ladies and we'll go to Ristorante Roma, have terrible service, a fantastic meal and drink some incredible wine.

36:19.50
Jon
I like it.

36:21.17
Stan Lemon
You tell me when.

36:23.07
Jon
I'll go look at who's playing.

36:25.30
Stan Lemon
Yeah, you should. You should. So, um, I, it's, it's a, it's definitely an eclectic venue. Like, this is not, it's only, i don't know, maybe thousand or 2000 people who can fit in this space. So you're not getting like top, I don't want to say top shelf. Cause I think these, these are, like, these are real musicians. They're not like Katy Perry jumping on stage. I don't know why I'm on a Katy Perry rant, but, um,

36:50.96
Stan Lemon
they're They're not going to sell out a big venue like Gainbridge, but they are going to be some of the best music you've probably seen and all in a really long time. you know So, yeah.

36:59.28
Jon
Nice.

37:00.31
Stan Lemon
All right, Jonathan. ah I said we were going to do an AI pro tip, and I haven't asked you about an AI pro tip. So...

37:09.74
Jon
you did a You did charge me with coming up with something because AI pro tips are apparently a recurring segment now.

37:16.88
Stan Lemon
i want I want them to be a recurring segment. I believe that we can be the AI whispers of 2026 right here on Life with a Twist of Lemon, and we will do it one...

37:27.61
Jon
I think that we could be the AI whispers for like everyday people and improving their life with AI. I think like there's this whole other segment of people who like go way too deep and are super nerdy about it.

37:33.74
Stan Lemon
Yeah, this one.

37:39.98
Stan Lemon
This podcast isn't for them anyhow.

37:40.20
Jon
And it's like, no. Right.

37:42.03
Stan Lemon
Yeah. if that If that's you listening right now, just cover your ears because what we're about to say, you're gonna be like, duh.

37:42.76
Jon
No.

37:47.89
Jon
So last week, your tip was basically don't use AI like Google. Give it context. Right?

37:53.11
Stan Lemon
Yeah. Yep.

37:53.97
Jon
OK. So this week, I think that I'm going to go with a hot take, and it's a tip of something not to do. And that's going to be don't use AI to generate content.

38:06.42
Stan Lemon
Oh, okay. Generate content at all?

38:09.78
Jon
generate content like on the first pass. So you can use it for, hey, give me ideas for something, a brainstorming session. um But I think that I have the most success with ai when I give it a lot upfront. um So maybe these are notes from a meeting. Maybe this is my scattered ah kind of stream of consciousness thoughts about a topic or what I wanted to do. um And then you feed it the raw human material um And then you can start to use it as kind of a second brain to test ideas or as an editor to start to compile them in orders that make sense, um things of that nature.

38:48.37
Stan Lemon
Okay, this is interesting. Let me something by you and you can tell me how far off I am. um i will occasionally dump, ill I'll create a conversation or you in a very extreme case, a project in ChatGPT, but a conversation, I will dump chunks of text and thoughts over the course of a week, right?

39:06.37
Stan Lemon
So these are like three, four, or five sentences, sometimes even a paragraph.

39:06.46
Jon
Yep.

39:10.24
Stan Lemon
And if i find a document that's relevant, I'll dump that in. And then I'll say, draft me a, you know, a, don't know, a blog post or whatever about this.

39:20.62
Jon
Right. So I think that's probably passable, but I think that if you tell it, hey, draft me a blog post about social media marketing in 2026 and leave it there, that's not going to do it. Now, if you have like, hey, I want my headings to be these things where I really want to dial in focus on um these are my social media aspects, um I think that there's something to be said there.

39:46.16
Stan Lemon
interesting so i i think i agree with you in spirit for the mere mortal amongst us ah but i've i've definitely just gone full whole hog write me content

39:59.38
Jon
Well, and I mean, I think our podcast theme song turned out okay that way.

40:03.47
Stan Lemon
oh yeah yeah yeah i agree with you there i'm trying to find i uh i have a i have a like a post that is a satirical critique of Moby Dick. I think I've shared it with you.

40:17.56
Jon
Mm-hmm.

40:18.26
Stan Lemon
um yeah i' i'll read I'll read the opening couple of paragraphs here just to set content, like, so you understand what I'm going to explain how I got to here, right? So ah it's the title of it is the case for harpooning Moby Dick.

40:31.28
Stan Lemon
The subtitle is a necessary ban to save the planet. Okay.

40:35.35
Jon
Yep.

40:35.47
Stan Lemon
Okay. It is with the gravest environmental conscience and deepest moral outrage that I propose we ban Herman Melville's Moby Dick, a novel which, under the guise of quote-unquote classic literature, promotes unclean energy consumption, capitalist exploitation, and the wholesale destruction of whales, plankton, and biological extension the ozone layer.

40:55.89
Stan Lemon
Indeed, it is nothing less than a fossil-fueled roadmap to planetary annihilation disguised as art. To begin, Moby Dick is a 600-page advertisement for the whaling industry.

41:07.41
Stan Lemon
Melville devotes entire chapters to whale biology and blubber extraction, offering technical manuals for aspiring 19th century petro barons.

41:15.50
Jon
That is true.

41:15.89
Stan Lemon
when When Captains Ahab snarls, I'll chase him round good hope round the horn.

41:16.59
Jon
And it's awful.

41:22.22
Stan Lemon
What he means is, burn more carbon, lads. Today's coal-fired power plants are merely Pequots. That's the name of the ship, right? From, from Moby Dick. With smokestacks. Pequots with smokestacks. The only difference is that Melville romanticized the process. One may as well assign ExxonMobil's quarterly reports to high school juniors and call it literature. All right.

41:44.20
Stan Lemon
Now, could you see me writing this?

41:47.75
Jon
No, but I could see you coming up with the idea.

41:50.09
Stan Lemon
Okay, I came up with the idea and I tossed it into ChatUpt with very little meat. and ah and And I'll put it into this. And I've just read you the first two paragraphs.

41:59.40
Jon
So that's not entirely true either, Stan, though, because I'm sure that ChatGPT has the entirety of Moby Dick and the storyline and everything there that is context.

42:09.83
Stan Lemon
Well, Yeah.

42:10.78
Jon
So...

42:11.27
Stan Lemon
Okay, fair enough. But but like this is one of those places where I'm like, go write me some content. you know

42:16.73
Jon
Hmm.

42:17.45
Stan Lemon
And i didn't I didn't start with a piece of my own content. i think I think there's a way to do this well, maybe, assuming that this satirical piece on Moby Dick.

42:27.16
Jon
I'm saying that 80% of people and the garbage that is in even news articles now um and social feeds is awful.

42:37.80
Stan Lemon
It is awful. And actually the news article thing that that really resonates with me because I can like, I don't think they're using ChatGPT.

42:48.43
Jon
Right.

42:48.80
Stan Lemon
Claude either. Whatever they're using seems like hot trash because the quality of text is so poor. Like it's very clear that there's a word count that they're trying to hit and there's a reading level.

42:59.35
Jon
Mm-hmm.

43:01.42
Stan Lemon
um And that's it. And I think that actually is like really sad. It's sad sad for the state of reporting, but also sad to be on the receiving end of this. So I'm with you from that lens. And I think I had this, ah I believe there's an existential crisis that we're all going to face with AI in terms of content generation, which is you you made an very important observation.

43:25.53
Stan Lemon
ChatGPT may have been able to produce this masterpiece of satire on Moby Dick because it has the entire text of Moby Dick. And so you know if I asked it to go write me a critique of the Iliad, I think it could do a pretty solid job because it has all the Iliad, because it's built on this existing content base.

43:47.21
Stan Lemon
so So the existential crisis that i worry about is we are generating all this crap content with AI, right? And it's just gonna be fed back into the model. And there's there's really nothing to protect the development of these models, the development of the information thereof from this crap content. Because there's no way that there's no way to discern that this is you know a fourth grader who probably should still be in first grade, or maybe you should say a ninth grader should still be in fourth grade, I don't know, versus an AI.

44:16.68
Jon
Yep. um And I mean, we had this problem before. um I think like as we were growing up, it was very much, hey, don't use the internet for research.

44:27.88
Stan Lemon
Right, yeah. Whatever you do, don't don't cite Wikipedia as a reference, which today, like, i here it's peer-reviewed, right?

44:29.03
Jon
so

44:32.88
Jon
Right. Hey, Wikipedia is peer-reviewed, at least. Yeah.

44:38.54
Stan Lemon
Yeah. This is actually, we had this conversation my house a couple times because, ah you know, Mrs. Levin is still kind of like old school on this front. i'm like, hey, look, I'm going to be honest with you. I think there's a legitimate chance that the the peer review for Wikipedia is superior to Britannica at this point.

44:57.19
Stan Lemon
Okay, that's my hot take.

44:57.22
Jon
Probably.

44:58.82
Stan Lemon
That's my hot take. And she's like, no, no, no, there's there's like reputation, blah, blah, blah. I'm like, no, I like, you have to, I have tried multiple times to edit Wikipedia pages, right?

45:10.36
Stan Lemon
Like i in fact, um the Washington Monument article, I have many times attempted to update it to reference Spider-Man's involvement, right?

45:20.32
Stan Lemon
Right.

45:22.47
Stan Lemon
And they don't last more than five seconds before they get rejected. So there's a combination of computers and humans that I think you know ensures some decent quality stuff. And when the quality can't be validated well enough, it also says so upfront.

45:35.05
Stan Lemon
Like, hey, you know this is not maybe up to our standards. And you don't get that from

45:39.25
Jon
Well, and like you have the references all over the place. And when there is no reference, it says citation needed.

45:43.37
Stan Lemon
all of them. Yep, yep.

45:46.16
Jon
um Like maybe you don't use this as your only source, um but I think it's a darn good resource and maybe a place to start.

45:54.73
Stan Lemon
Yeah, I agree with you. And so, you know, kind of to your point, like it didn't start that way, right? it took some time. um we have We have faced the onslaught of questionable content on the internet for as long as the internet's been around and we will continue to face it.

46:06.69
Jon
Yep.

46:08.20
Stan Lemon
I just worry about when you get crap in, going to put crap out, right?

46:13.48
Jon
Absolutely.

46:14.22
Stan Lemon
And so-

46:14.44
Jon
I think the the other thing here is people still need to learn how to read and consume content critically, um which I think something is that you've been working on ah very much so even now in your, I won't say your age, um but also with your kids.

46:25.00
Stan Lemon
Yes.

46:33.05
Jon
So yeah.

46:34.92
Stan Lemon
Yeah. And, uh, see if this makes sense. Like, um they were telling you that like when they Google, they can't find things as effectively as you do. Have you heard that?

46:45.87
Jon
Yeah.

46:46.44
Stan Lemon
Yeah. Okay. Uh, I always think about this, right? Like, what is it that allows my Google results to be better than yours? Or, you know, yours, proverbial yours, right?

46:54.96
Jon
I mean, we ask better questions.

46:56.90
Stan Lemon
We ask better questions. I think we also have a little bit better discernment for the results that come back.

47:02.81
Jon
Hmm.

47:03.02
Stan Lemon
and And that is even more so true with AI content today. We've talked a little about hallucinations, right? Hallucinations are where the model presents something as truth that is not, right?

47:17.74
Stan Lemon
and Like everybody has a BS detector and you should be able to sniff out some of that. Right. And I think the minute that you stop looking at AI answers, AI responses without your BS detector and in like full tilt, you're going to get burned.

47:36.20
Jon
but That also means you have to review the AI answers before you paste and publish them somewhere.

47:42.73
Stan Lemon
Absolutely. Yeah, that, gosh, we could probably do a whole other thing. Okay, you you've you've had me think about this since you brought this up. Do you, because you were, um I don't remember exactly what she said. that Your first line was something the effect of um the questions you ask it or it's not just a search engine, something the effect, don't remember.

48:02.28
Stan Lemon
Does ring a bell? No.

48:03.75
Jon
From last week?

48:05.10
Stan Lemon
No, this week, in this conversation, you had a comment about search engines.

48:09.38
Jon
Because we asked better questions than...

48:11.18
Stan Lemon
No, no, no, further back. All right, it's fine.

48:12.60
Jon
Birvek?

48:12.66
Stan Lemon
It's fine. The robots will figure it out. Okay. You made me think of this. umm guys swear you said something.

48:16.36
Jon
Okay, go.

48:17.21
Stan Lemon
Yeah. ChatGPT keeps wanting to make itself into a search engine, right? Like if you install the ChatGPT extension into Google Chrome, it will ask you to set itself as your search engine. You can do the same thing actually on iOS as well.

48:31.82
Stan Lemon
It is a terrible, terrible, terrible idea, right? It's a terrible idea because one, it it also messes with your context and all the things going on in your conversation management for the AI. But also like to be completely frank with you, it's not at that level. It's not showing you things you're looking for. It's trying to answer the underlying question. And if you're genuinely just looking for stuff, ChatGPT still stinks, right? Like i would challenge you right now. Here's one thing I have not been able to get to do.

48:58.54
Stan Lemon
I want something that will take a tissue box and elevate it an inch off the ground. That's it, right? I want like a tissue box tray. I can see it in my head. And I've asked ChatGPT, scour the internet and find it.

49:13.16
Stan Lemon
You cannot do it, right? You cannot just give me like a list of things and then I sort through them. It wants to find just the one answer. And if the thing you're trying to do is not geared around towards, it's sorry, not geared towards just the one answer, it will fail you.

49:25.99
Stan Lemon
It will fail you miserably.

49:28.71
Jon
Why don't you just build something, Stan? Like...

49:32.33
Stan Lemon
Because it's so much easier to just click a button on Amazon.

49:34.63
Jon
It's like a 2x4, isn't it?

49:34.97
Stan Lemon
don't

49:37.13
Stan Lemon
John, gonna like, i want my my bathroom with this thing's gonna be a little classy, right?

49:37.99
Jon
ah

49:41.77
Jon
ah okay

49:42.21
Stan Lemon
Come on. Come on. This is actually like, want to talk about problems, like real world problems. So the the tissue box sits on the sink counter and the sink counter is mostly level, but there's a slight tilt in the back of it, in the in the middle, right?

49:57.48
Stan Lemon
So water, moisture in in general, will roll that back. And where do you think I put the tissue box? And so then the tissue box is sitting there or the humidity from the air might get under there. i don't know what it is. Like, you know, take a shower. And then i go to lift at the tissue box and the bottom of the tissue box is stuck to the counter. And it leaves this little paper residue. And I got to scrape it up with my finger and it gets under my fingernail. It's uncomfortable. And I just don't like it, Jonathan.

50:21.16
Jon
sounds awful. um

50:22.15
Stan Lemon
i need I need AI to solve that problem. And I can't do it.

50:26.31
Jon
think you should just talk to the people who are artistically inclined in your household and they will build you something.

50:32.71
Stan Lemon
But they're not, they're like, okay, they' they're going to sew something or paint something. They're not going to, they're not in like, what is that, material science? They're not, you know. Different type of art, Jonathan.

50:43.73
Stan Lemon
Different type of art.

50:43.92
Jon
Alright, I feel like this is a pretty solvable thing, Stan. Maybe it's just, you know, by a shelf that you hang on the wall that you set the tissue box on.

50:52.01
Stan Lemon
I got the big, I got the big um mirror, right? Like, I'm actually like, I'm limited by my options. The mirror takes up that whole wall. I guess I could hang it above the door.

51:02.21
Jon
What's the vanity made out of? You could cut one of those like in the hotels where they have the tissue box underneath.

51:08.28
Stan Lemon
I'd have to remove a drawer. drawers Drawers in the vanity are precious, Jonathan.

51:13.88
Stan Lemon
I'm just saying like, I feel like this is a space where the internet in particular, AI could help me find the thing I need you know to solve all my problems.

51:25.42
Jon
Yeah.

51:26.79
Stan Lemon
But can't do it.

51:27.30
Jon
Anyways, we've got this, a couple of topics from your daughters. Do we want to tackle the glow up one here in the last 10 minutes?

51:35.40
Stan Lemon
i don't even know I don't even know what a glow up is. Well, Lucy sent this. Maybe we should just have her come on the podcast and talk with us.

51:41.32
Jon
And talk about it.

51:41.48
Stan Lemon
But she texted me, ah, new topic discussion for the podcast.

51:42.12
Jon
Okay.

51:45.10
Stan Lemon
Define what a glow up is and reflect on your 2025 glow ups. Do you know what glow up is?

51:49.93
Jon
So I always thought this was like the um like the awkward middle schoolers, like pretty much everyone is, um becoming attractive people as they grow up. um But when we lock it down to a 2025 glow up, the context no longer makes sense.

52:05.86
Stan Lemon
Yeah, I don't i don't know. like so i i All right, I'm Googling. A person's transformation into a more attractive or accomplished version of themselves. Yeah, that this yeah I am less accomplished in 2025 than I was in 2024.

52:13.83
Jon
You accomplished. What made us more accomplished in 2025?

52:19.18
Jon
Hey, we started restarted Life with Twisted Woman recording um on a regular cadence.

52:24.20
Stan Lemon
Oh, I am more accomplished.

52:25.58
Jon
So, yeah.

52:26.89
Stan Lemon
Yeah. um Yeah, I i don't i don know. I think we probably, maybe we may just ask her. And then the other one was from Evelyn, my my youngest.

52:36.63
Jon
Evelyn sounds like she wants to be on the on the podcast to talk about this.

52:39.59
Stan Lemon
absolutely Absolutely.

52:39.91
Jon
So...

52:40.19
Stan Lemon
So here's funny thing. On the previous rendition of the podcast, right? All three kids made an appearance. um Lucy remembers hers. Henry kind of does. Evelyn does not at all, right?

52:51.14
Stan Lemon
So Evelyn desperately wants to have that that core memory, right? Of being the podcast. Yeah. So she sent me a text. Can you please do a Life with a Twisted Lemon episode all about cooking and King Arthur and maybe include a kid who likes to cook?

53:06.47
Stan Lemon
Right. So I think we could do that. I think we could, maybe we'll, we'll strategize around favorite recipes, baking and otherwise, and go from there. But I think, I feel like those deserve, first of all, the globe one, that's a 16 year old who's just texting whatever randomly, but you know, you know, it might be related.

53:22.00
Jon
Yeah.

53:23.98
Stan Lemon
i don't know if it's not related. Maybe it's not. Have you seen these Instagram posts that are all 2016? Yeah.

53:30.74
Jon
Oh, I have.

53:31.66
Stan Lemon
yeah Have you, have you gone through, looked at like pictures at yourself in 2016? Yeah.

53:35.24
Jon
No. It's like, is are we just doing this because it was a decade ago or what?

53:39.76
Stan Lemon
I think so. So somebody figured out that this is the thing, right? To do, you do pictures of yourself a decade ago. um I went back and I looked at pictures of me in 2016. I don't wanna share these.

53:49.50
Jon
There's probably some of us together, right?

53:51.75
Stan Lemon
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so. Yeah, here we go. I wanted, um here we go. You know what we were doing in August 2016?

54:03.28
Stan Lemon
We were at Patty's wedding.

54:05.91
Jon
a Ah.

54:07.09
Stan Lemon
There's some pictures of us. ah Looks like at, I've got a picture actually of Anna and Sarah playing some kind of game. Remember when we went to the the batting cage?

54:17.74
Jon
Oh, that's right.

54:18.71
Stan Lemon
Yeah.

54:18.74
Jon
Yeah.

54:19.41
Stan Lemon
And there's a couple of pictures of us from the wedding. So I got that for sure.

54:23.74
Jon
Yeah.

54:24.98
Stan Lemon
But we also camped, I think. I think I got pictures of that. i think that was 2016 as well. Maybe?

54:31.73
Jon
It all sounds right.

54:31.86
Stan Lemon
Yeah. Yeah. Jonathan, we went, it was that Labor Day. We went and camped together. So there you go, 2016. We can do a 2016 podcast post. I just don't think this was the best version of ourselves.

54:43.80
Stan Lemon
Right? And I'm not really sure that I want to share pictures.

54:44.34
Jon
Probably not. I think we both made some good decisions in 2016.

54:51.44
Stan Lemon
what What's it What decision did make in 2016? Yeah.

54:54.43
Jon
Right?

54:55.79
Jon
Career changes.

54:57.12
Stan Lemon
Oh, career changes. That was 2016. Man, I can't even me map that in my brain. Yeah. I guess we did. Gosh. Time flies.

55:08.14
Stan Lemon
All right. Well, maybe.

55:08.71
Jon
there an easy way to find 2016? Do you just search 2016 in the Photos app?

55:12.62
Stan Lemon
I just go to the all photos view, switch the years, and then I zero in on the years and kind of scroll through from there.

55:17.47
Jon
Okay.

55:18.30
Stan Lemon
Because once you double click on years, you can start scrolling through months. um I will admit that i like I'm still frustrated with the iPhone photos app overhaul.

55:29.14
Stan Lemon
But yeah, it looks like I went to...

55:30.32
Jon
Yeah. Hey, I was making bread.

55:32.50
Stan Lemon
Oh, there you go, Jonathan.

55:32.89
Jon
i was making sourdough in 2016.

55:36.06
Stan Lemon
See, that was a good year. I probably gave you the starter too, right?

55:39.06
Jon
Right.

55:39.95
Stan Lemon
Yeah, crazy times.

55:40.85
Jon
So that was, we were making sourdough before making sourdough was cool.

55:44.50
Stan Lemon
Yeah, before it was super trendy. So it it appears that I went to Atlanta a couple of times. It appears that I went to Alabama. It appears that I went to Kansas. And it appears that I went to Gatlinburg in Nashville. And wherever we went for, oh, I went to to Traverse City as well.

56:04.43
Stan Lemon
And then ah it looks like I also went to wherever we went camping. That was in Illinois, I think.

56:10.90
Jon
ah so Was it outside Bloomington maybe?

56:13.17
Stan Lemon
Maybe, yeah. I don't know.

56:15.74
Jon
Was it 2016 when I bought my bike?

56:18.74
Stan Lemon
No, I don't think so. Cause I bought my bike. I think I bought my bike in 2017. So now 2017, when we get to 2027, I'll do through some, le I will do some throwback pictures on 2017 because that's when I went crazy on the cycling.

56:34.08
Stan Lemon
there's a lot of good cycling selfies, but anyhow, I have no idea this is what Lucy meant by a glow up, but you know, that's, we'll have ask.

56:36.75
Jon
Nice.

Well, Jonathan, I don't know if we'll record again before I get back. Seems unlikely just because the schedule is unforgiving. But I want you to know that I will think of you while I am sailing the Eastern Caribbean, sipping a glass of wine on, it won't be deck four because deck four is not the same on the wish class, but but it'll be whatever the equivalent is.
