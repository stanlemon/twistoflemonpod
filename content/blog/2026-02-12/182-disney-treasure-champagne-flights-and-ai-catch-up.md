Dear Listener,

Stan returns from the Disney Treasure with a mix of gratitude and hot takes. Bad weather wiped out most port plans, but the conversation turns into a practical breakdown of Triton class design: stairwells, crowd flow, dead ends, and why Cove Cafe access felt like a miss compared to older ships. Along the way, they compare the Treasure to Dream, Fantasy, and Wonder, with some surprising rankings.

Food and wine are the real headliners this week. Stan and Jon cover Marceline wins, Coco's standout show-and-menu combo, and Enchante as a full experience worth trying at least once. They swap tasting notes from multiple wine and champagne pairings, including Dom Perignon, Cristal, and a Robert Mondavi bottle that sparked a full Disney magic moment across dining rooms.

The episode closes with future cruise planning and a quick AI-state-of-the-union: Xcode's new agentic mode, Codex on Mac, Claude and Cursor updates, and waiting on ChatGPT's newer integrations.

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
