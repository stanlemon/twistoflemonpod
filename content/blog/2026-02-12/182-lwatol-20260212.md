  Stan returns from a weather-disrupted Disney Treasure sailing where only one
  planned port made the itinerary, then breaks down what worked and what did
  not on the Triton class layout, from deck flow and dead ends to Cove Cafe
  access. The conversation shifts to standout dining at Coco and Enchante,
  wine and champagne tastings, and several Disney-level service moments before

Stan Lemon
Well, Jonathan, it's cold in the Midwest.

00:01:00.25
Jon
Well, it sounded like it was cold where you were too.

00:01:04.18
Stan Lemon
Yes, but it is relative cold, right? So this is like crazy.

00:01:06.86
Jon
OK.

00:01:09.50
Stan Lemon
Where I was at was cold for what I expected, but still warmer than here.

00:01:16.70
Jon
Well, I like the ah ball cap that you got. I assume that's a new purchase.

00:01:21.24
Stan Lemon
start. No, I did not purchase this hat. I got this hat from the cruise director.

00:01:28.03
Jon
Ah, we'll get to that later.

00:01:29.82
Stan Lemon
This was a gift. Yeah, we'll get to that later. No, so um ah stories of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. i ah was disconnected from the universe mostly for a week.

00:01:43.32
Stan Lemon
My cruise ship was destined... to stop in three locations, but it only made one. And ah let's just say there's not a lot going on in Tortola.

00:01:54.78
Stan Lemon
And it was rainy and windy, but we got off the boat, we walked around. Our excursions were canceled across the board. But as my dear friend Jonathan reminded me, the ship is the destination.

00:02:09.53
Jon
That is how I cruise. At this point, I feel like you cruise very differently than I do, but you know,

00:02:16.15
Stan Lemon
know that that's I don't know that that's true, okay? So I, because I enjoy the boat. i enjoy the boat a lot, right? I think what messes me on this time around, because I love a good day at sea. Like I genuinely love a day at sea.

00:02:30.14
Stan Lemon
But if you wake up and you're planning to go ashore, and then you watch the boat approach shore and then pull away, like a messes with you, right? And then in the case of Castaway Key, which I was really excited to go to, if you watch the boat do that twice, first of all, it's a lot of time, you know, right?

00:02:48.88
Stan Lemon
Like i I'm not gonna go commit to go doing something else, cause like, oh, maybe we're gonna get off the boat, maybe we're not.

00:02:49.57
Jon
Yep. Yep.

00:02:54.39
Stan Lemon
Um, and you know, like, i don't know. It just, it's, it, it's different to not stop someplace where you thought you were gonna stop and to have a sea day are very different.

00:03:05.73
Stan Lemon
Right. That's, that's my, that's my big takeaway from this, this trip. So I will say, uh, I still love cruising and I am not, like down on Disney or anything like that because of this, like they can't control the weather. Um, they prioritized safety and we, you know, we did what we had to do. um but I would have loved to have stopped. I would loved to stopped at Castaway in particular.

00:03:31.05
Jon
Yep. The Disney Islands are fantastic and are so far my favorite ports, but I haven't been on an Alaska or European sailing.

00:03:39.77
Stan Lemon
So Alaska and Europe, you've got to categorize those as different kinds of cruising. right they're They're just fundamentally different. When you talk about Western Caribbean, Eastern Caribbean, Bahamas, right?

00:03:52.41
Stan Lemon
I think you can generally lump those together. And ah i you know, there's cool stuff to do on those islands, but you're not, you're not going, like nobody's going to Jamaica or Grand Cayman to see um ah the Parthenon, right? Like that's not, that's not the type of destination it is.

00:04:14.23
Stan Lemon
It doesn't make it any less special or anything like that, but it's it's not that kind of destination. And so what you do, how you think about it the way you plan for it is just it's just fundamentally different, right?

00:04:24.15
Jon
Fair enough. Although of the Caribbean ah cruise itineraries, supposedly you were just on the one with the best ports, which I guess you can't speak to because you didn't stop at the one end.

00:04:38.71
Stan Lemon
Yeah, we didn't we didn't make it to St. Thomas. So it's a seven night cruise. There were three days um with ports. It was going to be St. Thomas, Tortola and Castaway Cay. Everybody loves Castaway Cay. I mean, there's there's nothing to not love. Like it's it's just fantastic in every way.

00:04:54.74
Stan Lemon
uh, St. Thomas, I was looking forward to Tortola, like, you know, okay. I didn't know anything special about Tortola, but I will tell you Tortola was beautiful. like, it was absolutely gorgeous.

00:05:04.39
Jon
Yeah.

00:05:05.38
Stan Lemon
St. Thomas, we got pretty close to docking and it looked quite beautiful even with, you know, wind and maybe a little bit of schvizy rain. But, um,

00:05:16.57
Stan Lemon
Yeah, I don't know. they look they looked They look lovely. We were going to do a catamaran sail at one and then go to Joost van Dijk off of Tortola for the others. There was like a boat to a beach kind of thing. Those got canceled before we even got to the the island because of the wind.

00:05:32.92
Stan Lemon
um And yeah yeah I will say this. So I noticed the boat moving. But whatever they've done to the treasure in particular on the stabilizer front, or maybe it was just like brilliant navigating by the captain. I don't know.

00:05:49.56
Stan Lemon
It really wasn't a rocky cruise. Like there were a couple times where we noticed it, but I still, i still look back to the time I was on the wish in October um, where I could be laying in bed and I would be airborne, you know, like, yeah, like, yeah.

00:06:04.40
Jon
OK.

00:06:05.62
Stan Lemon
So same class even, but it was, it was just smoother and maybe, maybe it just wasn't that bad relative.

00:06:05.34
Jon
So same class, even.

00:06:12.23
Stan Lemon
I don't know. um But yeah, I will say, so i took more advantage of the treasure than we did the wish, but I really like the theming of the wish and the crew, sorry, I really like the theming of the treasure and the crew of the treasure was by far superior to what we experienced on the wish. Now these cruises are changing all the time. Every time they had a new boat, they take some of the best they move them the next boat. So I think there's an element of like, we got some of the best of the best on the treasure. um There were a number of folks that we had met previously in the fantasy or we'd met previously on the Wonder when we did Alaska. And I think i think you remember me telling you like the the Wonder, the crew there was just over the top phenomenal. And this won't give them a run for its money, I would say.

00:06:59.67
Stan Lemon
Yeah.

00:07:00.06
Jon
Nice. Well, a big thing going on right now is there are no Alaska sailings because that would be awful.

00:07:08.25
Stan Lemon
Yeah, I mean, like, it's it's too cold, right? But ah i the wonder is somewhere, right? the It's in the south, and I imagine they don't cruise

00:07:16.41
Jon
Is the Wonder the one that just left Australia? Okay.

00:07:19.87
Stan Lemon
that crew. Yeah, right, which Disney's no longer doing Australian cruises anymore.

00:07:22.81
Jon
Yeah, this is the last time in Australia.

00:07:24.70
Stan Lemon
Yeah, I'm sure that's a temporary thing, and I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the fact that they've got the adventure down there.

00:07:28.24
Jon
Oh, yeah.

00:07:30.52
Stan Lemon
But, um, yeah. So, you know, this boat, this boat is pretty controversial. I would say the Triton class is but pretty controversial, right? There's a lot of, lot of hate for the Wish, which was the first Triton class boat.

00:07:43.83
Stan Lemon
Um, and I don't, I don't despise it, but I will say that when it comes to an at sea day, there's some serious problems with the layout of the ship.

00:07:43.80
Jon
Yep.

00:07:55.93
Jon
That seems to be the overwhelming ah critique of the... Do they call it Triton class still, or did they change it to Wish class? Because that's what everybody was calling it anyway.

00:08:06.91
Stan Lemon
I'm pretty sure it's just called the Triton class, but ah let's listen with the Triton class, which is the wish, the treasure and the destiny.

00:08:08.73
Jon
and Okay.

00:08:14.55
Stan Lemon
um So, you know, the thing that everybody on the internet talks about is the stairwell situation, right? And I think,

00:08:22.62
Jon
And like there's like the dream class is very, like you can just wander around and eventually it will land you somewhere. um Where it sounds like on the Triton class, you like wander around down a hallway and then you hit a dead end.

00:08:38.97
Stan Lemon
I don't know that you hit a lot of dead ends, so ah with some exceptions. let me let me Let me explain. So first of all, let me just talk about the stairwell issue, because I really do think this is overblown. The Dream class has three stairwells, right?

00:08:52.09
Stan Lemon
One in the main area in the open in the in the gallery, right? And then two in the back. And ah the Triton class has...

00:09:00.03
Jon
One in the front, one in the back.

00:09:02.50
Stan Lemon
It's really two in the back.

00:09:04.57
Jon
What do you mean?

00:09:06.71
Stan Lemon
There's... hold on.

00:09:06.52
Jon
I mean, you've you've got one in the atrium when you enter. You've got one forward of that and one aft of that.

00:09:16.62
Stan Lemon
There's three total.

00:09:18.66
Stan Lemon
I thought the two were in the back. Hold on, I gotta pull this up because gonna drive me nuts.

00:09:20.81
Jon
No.

00:09:23.49
Stan Lemon
So um this conversation actually is probably gonna make my point regardless. the um Two of those are heavily trafficked and one is not, in my experience.

00:09:34.63
Stan Lemon
Now, you know from sailing with me that I don't often know which way is, um yeah, the one in the back, the one behind cabanas is rarely trafficked. That's what I'm thinking of.

00:09:46.47
Stan Lemon
So you're right. There's one in the front by Cove Cafe.

00:09:46.62
Jon
Yeah.

00:09:49.19
Stan Lemon
we should talk about Cove Cafe because that was really frustrating on this boat. Yeah.

00:09:52.73
Jon
Oh, no.

00:09:53.95
Stan Lemon
so So the one in the back, though, not a lot of not a lot of action because it is literally in the very back of the boat. So these two on the Triton class are a little more centrally located. i i don't know numbers. I think the number of actual elevators per bank is higher.

00:10:10.11
Stan Lemon
It's definitely got to be higher in the main gallery. And that that, like, I guess on the dream would be the mid one, but it's the forward one. Yeah. And i like, i don't think it's as big of a problem as people make it out to be is what I would say.

00:10:24.48
Stan Lemon
Right.

00:10:24.74
Jon
Okay.

00:10:25.92
Stan Lemon
Cause I don't, I really don't believe that that back, um, set of elevators on the dream class is, is used much. Right. Cause it's like, it's literally right in front of the back cabins.

00:10:35.08
Jon
Sure.

00:10:40.35
Stan Lemon
It's all the way back there. So anyhow, I think that's overblown.

00:10:41.72
Jon
Yep.

00:10:44.10
Stan Lemon
Everybody makes a big to do about it, including my son. Um, You know, it is what it is

00:10:49.32
Jon
Who loves running around the ships anyway?

00:10:52.32
Stan Lemon
Yeah. Well, he he he gets around quite a bit.

00:10:52.39
Jon
yeah

00:10:54.80
Stan Lemon
he gets, what you know, else I'll say that. Okay. So ah in terms of dead ends, I didn't find a lot of dead ends, but I will say that this boat pushes you towards the middle in the way that it's laid out, right?

00:11:05.06
Jon
Hmm.

00:11:06.46
Stan Lemon
And so I think there might be less bars on this boat, I think. the The main bar, the Skipper Society on this one, I'm drawing a blank on what it's called now on the on the Wish, has an open ah plan kind of like the French Quarter does on the Wonder, right? which Which I've told you in the past, I love. Like that's my favorite place to hang out on any Disney ship ever.

00:11:33.28
Stan Lemon
And so you get that kind of effect, but it's still in the middle of the boat, which is kind of cool. And I dig that. ah the The Star Wars bar on the Wish and the Haunted Mansion bar on the Treasure are too small and they're too crowded.

00:11:47.20
Stan Lemon
So I find those quite unpleasant. theyre The theming, like if you're into that, cool.

00:11:49.88
Jon
Yeah.

00:11:51.34
Stan Lemon
When I was on the Wish, there was actually a time limit for how long you could stay in the Star Wars bar. They weren't doing that on the Haunted Mansion, which was good. the scat cat lounge is way too small.

00:12:01.86
Stan Lemon
I don't even know what the scat cat replaces. If that's supposed to replace ooh la la, I guess maybe because of the piano bar theme. um But it's down in the main area where, you know, like right off the open atrium area, right?

00:12:17.38
Stan Lemon
And so, and that would that like That was kind of annoying because I would have loved to have hang hung out in there, but every time I went in there, like literally every single seat was taken and there's no place to stand to hang out.

00:12:28.90
Stan Lemon
So not not great.

00:12:29.17
Jon
Yep.

00:12:30.08
Stan Lemon
right um A lot of the bars up deck, they're just like on the other boats.

00:12:30.27
Jon
Yep.

00:12:34.18
Stan Lemon
you know It was cold and it was windy and sometimes it was raining, so those weren't getting a lot of traffic. The The problem then is like, that's it. You know, you got the rose, which is up in like Palo territory, but the rose is a different beast because if you're going up there, like, first of all, I'm not going to my flip-flops, right? I think they'd let me, but I'm not, I'm not just not going to do it.

00:12:57.22
Stan Lemon
And um i guess that's the equivalent of the Meridian functionally, right?

00:13:01.53
Jon
Correct, yeah.

00:13:02.50
Stan Lemon
Yeah. And the Meridian actually, I think they actually do turn you away if you're, if you're not wearing slacks, if I recall.

00:13:09.25
Jon
Yeah, so they changed the hours, because that used to be open more often than it is. And now it's like open for pre-dinner time. And then they have the ah they've got the dress code all up there.

00:13:19.87
Stan Lemon
Yeah, it's not it's not very accessible, right? So but so the rose replaces that. But if you think about like the the number of things, oh, and you got the the pub, which the pub is is comparable, but you're missing like, is it? The skyline or whatever that's on the dream?

00:13:35.78
Jon
Yeah, I was wondering if Scat Cat was kind of like Skyliner.

00:13:39.14
Stan Lemon
I think Scat Cat is supposed to be like ooh la la, right? But it's,

00:13:42.85
Jon
So what's Ulala on the Dream?

00:13:45.80
Stan Lemon
Oh my gosh.

00:13:47.73
Jon
The District?

00:13:49.52
Stan Lemon
No. um Okay. What's the champagne place? Pink?

00:13:55.47
Jon
Pink, yeah.

00:13:57.06
Stan Lemon
Yeah.

00:13:56.43
Jon
Dumbo themed.

00:13:57.83
Stan Lemon
Isn't Ooh La La what it is on the fantasy? Am I am i like flipping things?

00:14:00.56
Jon
That could be. I haven't been on the Fantasy, so...

00:14:02.93
Stan Lemon
Okay. So so that that bar, that's what I think the scat cat replaces, right? But it's it's a totally different vibe because it's in the main walkway, right?

00:14:07.07
Jon
OK.

00:14:11.56
Stan Lemon
But it's a piano bar. That's principally what it is.

00:14:11.73
Jon
Sure.

00:14:14.13
Stan Lemon
the The Periscope on the Treasure, that was great. Really enjoyed that. It just so happened that i started reading 20,000 Under the Sea.

00:14:20.77
Jon
That's a pub for those playing at home.

00:14:23.03
Stan Lemon
for those Yeah, for those playing at home. So it just so happens I started to read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea on this cruise.

00:14:27.51
Jon
Nice.

00:14:28.69
Stan Lemon
And that's what the theme of this boat or that that that that pub is. And for those that don't know, Disney, like their first live action film was 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

00:14:39.12
Stan Lemon
And it was kind of like their foray into live action. It's like what what validated, what justified, what rationalized them as something more than animation studio. So it's kind of a cool little nod, you know?

00:14:51.06
Stan Lemon
But the problem is i think there's less space. There's less you know bar space in general. And um there's so much foot traffic pushed past the bars that they're more crowded. So the district, right, which I really like the district,

00:15:08.26
Stan Lemon
in the back of the dream, um it's, it's a little out of the way, right? Like you got the one, you got the one elevator bank back there, but you know, it's, it's a thing unto unto itself.

00:15:12.83
Jon
Yep.

00:15:19.11
Stan Lemon
If you're on the wonder, you've got the, what is it? The Cadillac lounge or whatever. That's way up front. It's, it's like, it's a little out of the way Like you got to go find it. You know, these, you just kind of like dump yourself into it, which is kind of like the French quarter on the wonder, but it's,

00:15:35.71
Stan Lemon
you you don't have as many people on the wonder. And so I think that that plays into it as well. um i don't know. Again, i feel like the bar stuff is more centrally located.

00:15:48.10
Stan Lemon
It pushes foot traffic there. the um i didn't have the dead end situation. I will say that the whole Palo thing is a little difficult to get to unless you know what you're doing because you like, there's only a couple of elevators that go all the way up there.

00:15:55.38
Jon
Yeah.

00:16:03.81
Stan Lemon
And if you don't take the elevator, you take the stairwell, which is next to Marceline market, which I should talk about a little bit too here.

00:16:14.43
Stan Lemon
But you when you walk up that that stairwell, you're at the hero zone, right? Which is their like indoor gym, which was super cool, super cool. And you have to like, you're facing the gym, you got to go left and then left.

00:16:26.11
Stan Lemon
And there's a nondescript door that you go through and then boom, you're like, you're walking into the rows and then you go into, you know, the the various restaurants. All

00:16:34.98
Jon
So that is similar to the Dream. Like, Pala is not super easy to get to on the Dream either.

00:16:41.53
Stan Lemon
right.

00:16:41.54
Jon
You have to kind of know where you're going. I think part of that is by design. Have you done any of the Art of the Theme tours on any the ships?

00:16:50.55
Stan Lemon
I've not, i probably should have done on this because I had plenty of time, but you know, it is what it is.

00:16:55.04
Jon
So basically, like the theming.

00:16:57.38
Stan Lemon
It

00:16:57.84
Jon
So when you're entering like adults only only areas, there's like built into kind of the vibe of it, something that makes it seem a little spooky or like kids aren't supposed to be there.

00:17:10.42
Jon
um So the kids will naturally turn away. So in the district, it gets dark. um the The carpet changes, things like that.

00:17:16.02
Stan Lemon
gets very dark. Yeah. Yeah.

00:17:18.92
Jon
um So like you're a little kid. It's like, oh, this doesn't seem like the place for me. um And so I wonder if Paulo is intentionally difficult to get to so kids don't just wander by it all the time.

00:17:30.56
Stan Lemon
That could be, that could be. um It's, we went to Enchante twice we went to the Rose once. And what I will say is, i did not get the Rose cocktail.

00:17:39.36
Jon
Did you get the rose cocktail?

00:17:43.64
Jon
Okay.

00:17:44.87
Stan Lemon
just Just so to clarify, Pink on the Dream, Ooh La La on the Fantasy. Those are the champagne bars. Scat Cat is not explicitly a champagne bar, but it is a piano bar.

00:17:55.31
Stan Lemon
If you recall from Pink, and Ooh La La is basically the same thing as Pink, there's there's a piano, right? like That's the central essential thing, a baby grand.

00:18:02.25
Jon
Yep. Yep. Hmm.

00:18:04.22
Stan Lemon
um So, you know, think... i think The district has more space and was more intimate than Skipper Society, right? Which is the the main bar area.

00:18:19.52
Stan Lemon
um i um I don't actually like Europa on the fantasy. So you've been on the dream with me. I've spent a lot of time in the district. I don't care for the Europa area on the fantasy.

00:18:30.31
Stan Lemon
And I finally figured out why. I had a heated debate with Henry. So the district, right, there's a stage, right? and then they're seating around the stage and there's a walkway and then there's the bar. Right. And so it's, it's, um it's like theater style, right. In terms of the way that it it amplifies on, on the fantasy, the bar is smack dab in the middle and you can walk her around both sides.

00:18:51.04
Stan Lemon
Right. And so you don't have central, you don't have central um entertainment in the same way.

00:18:52.90
Jon
interesting

00:18:57.90
Stan Lemon
And you've got a lot of like foot traffic in front of you. So the seating there is more like, um, ah what do you call Like benches where you slide into rather than tables or free floating tables.

00:19:11.21
Stan Lemon
They're like little circular benches.

00:19:11.95
Jon
Sure.

00:19:12.93
Stan Lemon
um And it it can be intimate if you like you're just talking to somebody, but you don't that i really like the entertainment atmosphere, which is again, like why I like the French Quarter on the Wonder so much.

00:19:13.51
Jon
Interesting.

00:19:23.62
Stan Lemon
But ah

00:19:23.91
Jon
So is this like evolution on the dream?

00:19:31.23
Stan Lemon
evolution, which one's evolution?

00:19:32.58
Jon
Evolution is the one where they do like karaoke and stuff. It's got the big butterfly on the ceiling above the bar that's centrally located. We don't spend a lot of time there historically.

00:19:40.50
Stan Lemon
Oh, no. You know, that's that's more like Triton Lounge. And and here's the thing, though.

00:19:43.42
Jon
Okay.

00:19:44.48
Stan Lemon
Or Sarabi, because this is another kind of oddity to the the Treasure. um The Treasure has this multi-floor. It's not a bar. It's ah it's just a venue called Sarabi. And then off of it is the Triton Lounge. And the Triton Lounge is where they do a lot of the karaoke stuff. Sarabi is a cool space, but it doesn't count as a bar. So, like, between these two, they're kind of different spins on both Evolution and the D Lounge.

00:20:11.81
Stan Lemon
because there's really, there's no D-lounge. The Triton Lounge is the closest thing to that, except it's way smaller than the D-lounge, and Sravya is bigger than Evolution, so.

00:20:18.69
Jon
Yeah, I think

00:20:22.43
Jon
so. Where did they do like animation classes or things like that?

00:20:27.55
Stan Lemon
ah So all over the place. They do some of those in Skipper. They do some of those in the Hey Hey Cafe.

00:20:30.52
Jon
OK.

00:20:33.60
Stan Lemon
um And they might have done some in Triton Lounge too, I don't know. But but theyre they're kind of scattered all over the place, yeah.

00:20:37.74
Jon
OK.

00:20:40.19
Stan Lemon
So, okay, all right. Just a very different take on bar location, venue location. Not bad, just different, right? But i again, i think the thing that this class of ship has done is put them in a more centrally trafficked area so that they're going to get more people in them, right?

00:21:01.86
Stan Lemon
Um, you and I have watched live entertainment in the dream back in the district with like two other people. Right. Which is, which is probably not, it's probably not great, but it also is is kind of nice for the the two people that show up, you know?

00:21:09.47
Jon
Right.

00:21:14.31
Jon
For us, right.

00:21:15.23
Stan Lemon
Yeah. So, um, you got that element to it, right? The Cove Cafe is the, the second biggest offense of this boat to me.

00:21:26.47
Stan Lemon
All right. And the the problem the problem of the Cove Cafe is related to the fact that you cannot walk around this boat.

00:21:27.39
Jon
Tell me more.

00:21:32.70
Stan Lemon
So the the places where the dead ends are, right? You have ah deck four, right? You can go upstairs and around the front um if you want, but you can't go around on the back.

00:21:44.41
Stan Lemon
Those are dead ends. Interestingly, you can walk down those stairwells if you are in safety boat, whatever S, they will they will have you exit after your safety orientation down those.

00:21:46.25
Jon
OK.

00:21:56.58
Stan Lemon
which I have no idea why they're not open all the time based upon what I saw.

00:21:56.89
Jon
Yeah.

00:22:00.40
Stan Lemon
Like I just, I have no idea. doesn't make any sense. it's not the same level, right? And so that's different than deck four. What I would say is deck four on this boat, it just doesn't get a lot of love, right?

00:22:11.87
Stan Lemon
um

00:22:11.71
Jon
yeah

00:22:12.80
Stan Lemon
Because people don't go out and just walk around, like do laps. where they do on on every other Disney boat. That is absolutely a thing. Some people are jogging. Some people are just walking, socializing. like it's ah It's a very animated area.

00:22:26.69
Stan Lemon
Because you don't have that, it pushes people inside. And I think that is a factor in why this boat feels more crowded to me. Now, I was on a cruise that was 75% capacity, right?

00:22:37.99
Stan Lemon
And it felt more crowded to me than any other cruise I've been on.

00:22:42.66
Jon
interesting yeah especially since capacity is based on two people per stateroom um and like Disney has you can fit what up to seven people in a stateroom no five people in a stateroom

00:22:43.81
Stan Lemon
Very nice, right? All right. So let's talk about Cove.

00:22:57.73
Stan Lemon
No, five, five. I don't know how you would possibly do seven. Five, I know you can do.

00:23:01.15
Jon
Right.

00:23:02.01
Stan Lemon
Five, five you do, yeah. um Yeah, it it it was odd. Like, in part of it, I want to chalk up to the weather, but I've, like, on the Wonder Cruise, which was pretty full, and there were, like, there were kids, there were all kinds of things going on.

00:23:19.87
Stan Lemon
um That cruise didn't feel as crowded. And people, like, they went out on deck, but not for long. You know, so that that's the other thing. Like i can't I can't wrap my head around everything that's going on, but think this deck four situation is at least part of it.

00:23:36.80
Stan Lemon
All right. Now, um up on the top deck, what you have is a situation where when you walk to the back and you are on the starboard side, you'll you'll go all the way to aft and you will find yourself in an infinity pool in front of the cove bar.

00:23:36.97
Jon
Come. Come.

00:23:56.00
Stan Lemon
Okay. The Nefee Pool, kind of cool. Also a little treacherous when the boat is rocking, creates these really crazy swirls that will like just throw you around.

00:24:07.97
Stan Lemon
I experienced these firsthand.

00:24:08.45
Jon
Nice.

00:24:09.89
Stan Lemon
um If you keep walking then to the port side, you'll get to the entrance to the Cove Cafe. Now the entire time that I've been walking from starboard near the the rear elevator, right, all the way around the back to get to the Cove Cafe, I'm outside.

00:24:28.90
Stan Lemon
completely exposed, right? Now, the Cove Cafe in Bad Weather, the Cove Cafe on the Dream and the Fantasy is technically outdoors, right?

00:24:31.07
Jon
In bad weather.

00:24:37.83
Stan Lemon
But there's overhead cover to get there.

00:24:38.44
Jon
Yep.

00:24:40.15
Stan Lemon
And you have no horrible sidewinds.

00:24:40.46
Jon
Yep.

00:24:43.43
Stan Lemon
So to get to the Cove Cafe was awful. Like it was genuinely awful. Now, if you miss the Cove Cafe and you keep walking past it on the port side, you will hit a dead end, which I'm not even sure what's on the other side of that. I don't know if that's, it's it's got to be maybe Enchante,

00:24:58.21
Stan Lemon
Apollo could be, I don't know.

00:24:58.02
Jon
Okay.

00:24:59.47
Stan Lemon
I'm not, I'm not totally sure.

00:24:59.66
Jon
Now.

00:25:01.03
Stan Lemon
Um, but that's a dead end, right? And that makes no sense that like, that's just, it's just bad design at that point. But the Cove Cafe is one of those places where on previous cruise, I think in fact, the last cruise that I went on with you, I think I went every morning to get my wife a coffee after I went to the gym.

00:25:17.63
Stan Lemon
Right. And, and then came back. So, um, the gym on this class boat sucks too, to be clear. Like, ah the problem with it though, i don't know. Well, I, there's a bunch of problems with it, but um I ended up, I think I only went to the cove twice on a seven day cruise, which is unusual.

00:25:36.16
Stan Lemon
So, you know,

00:25:36.55
Jon
this Now they have like a a coffee bar somewhere else on the ship, right?

00:25:44.93
Stan Lemon
They have the, yeah.

00:25:44.23
Jon
Off the atrium usually.

00:25:46.73
Stan Lemon
So they have the Hey Hey Cafe and it's great, but they don't have all of the accoutrements in terms of the types of things that they can make.

00:25:57.84
Stan Lemon
So one things love about the Cove Cafe is I walk up and I pick my bean, right? And I pick my method of brewing. Do I want an AeroPress, a Chemex, a Siphon?

00:26:07.93
Stan Lemon
Like you choose the option, right?

00:26:09.41
Jon
I have never done any of these things, so I should probably book a cruise with you again.

00:26:12.09
Stan Lemon
all right. So, you know, it's funny.

00:26:13.83
Jon
but yeah

00:26:18.31
Stan Lemon
you're You're definitely one of these like do as I say, not as I do kind of types when it comes to cruising.

00:26:23.51
Jon
So like this, I didn't tell you about, I told you about the snacks and I go in for the snacks all the time.

00:26:27.91
Stan Lemon
yeah well But here's the funny thing. They don't have those at the at the Cove on the Treasure. So like the little the little cranberry bars that are epic or the charcuterie boards. The charcuterie boards are available in Marceline every day at lunch.

00:26:42.43
Stan Lemon
But yeah, that was actually...

00:26:43.54
Jon
But like for that five o'clock adults only, like I'm tired of people.

00:26:49.19
Stan Lemon
It's not there, man.

00:26:49.09
Jon
No, nothing for that.

00:26:50.07
Stan Lemon
It's not there. Yeah.

00:26:50.59
Jon
Interesting.

00:26:51.52
Stan Lemon
And, uh, the coffee was good.

00:26:50.72
Jon
Interesting.

00:26:53.53
Stan Lemon
The coffee was great. Don't get me wrong. But that coffee with a little cranberry cheese, cream, cream cheese frosting, like square, whatever.

00:27:03.42
Stan Lemon
Oh, like that's actually next level. So, um, I am curious to see if the treats survived on the older boats.

00:27:15.55
Stan Lemon
um Yeah, but Cove Cafe, that was a big letdown for me. i think deck four is just an all-around disappointment. I think it drives people inside.

00:27:23.85
Jon
So did they still have like comfy loungers and things like that on deck 4, or no?

00:27:28.85
Stan Lemon
Uh, they were all at the only time I went, I only went on deck for like twice and both times they were all roped up because of the wind.

00:27:33.75
Jon
Yeah.

00:27:37.65
Stan Lemon
Right.

00:27:37.73
Jon
Yeah.

00:27:39.06
Stan Lemon
Um, yeah, like I didn't even,

00:27:41.04
Jon
Because like that's a nice, calm place.

00:27:43.60
Stan Lemon
art

00:27:42.92
Jon
like You've spent days there.

00:27:45.35
Stan Lemon
I've spent days there.

00:27:44.80
Jon
oh

00:27:46.07
Stan Lemon
Yeah. Yeah. I've, in fact, one of my favorite things to do in Nassau is to not get off the boat, but to sit on those chairs and watch the super cruisers, the super yachts, excuse me, go back and forth.

00:27:57.79
Stan Lemon
Right. um So in, in that regard, Nap.

00:28:00.02
Jon
You know what my favorite thing to do at NASA is?

00:28:03.19
Stan Lemon
Nap.

00:28:04.31
Jon
No, so I always go up to, um on the Dream, it's the Meridian. And on the one side, you can go out, and it's a smoking area. So I think every time we've been out in Nassau, take my pipe up there, and i smoke a pipe, also an import.

00:28:18.93
Stan Lemon
Oh, there you All right. Yeah. Yeah.

00:28:20.41
Jon
So.

00:28:21.36
Stan Lemon
I don't, I couldn't tell you, I don't think there's a venue like that on this boat. There are the smoking sections. And I will say that in terms of the placement of those, they're a little more out of the way.

00:28:31.87
Stan Lemon
Like I don't have to go walk through them to get to the adult section. Um, yeah, but in general, uh, I don't, I don't think that if that experience exists, I don't know where it is.

00:28:35.18
Jon
That's good.

00:28:43.06
Stan Lemon
so um, yeah,

00:28:43.27
Jon
Interesting. Oh,

00:28:46.23
Stan Lemon
So John, i tried to I tried to do everything you ever told me to do on this on this cruise, right? So yeah, everything.

00:28:50.74
Jon
yeah.

00:28:53.30
Stan Lemon
Eight,

00:28:53.11
Jon
i was good So the first thing I put in our agenda was John the Influencer, because I feel like I i live by influence at work. I have no authority. um But I feel like I've also influenced you um as you are on what number sailing was this?

00:29:08.02
Stan Lemon
eight, eight.

00:29:07.47
Jon
Seven? Eight?

00:29:10.03
Stan Lemon
eight

00:29:10.13
Jon
The eighth sailing of the Disney Cruise and drinking wine and going out of your way to know things about wine. So...

00:29:20.05
Stan Lemon
So I had like, as far as wine goes, this was a fascinating cruise too. But let me, let me just ah rewind a little bit here. So things that I know Jonathan Kohlmeier wants me to do on a boat, right? I got to have some chicken tenders and got to have some pizza, right?

00:29:35.44
Jon
So the chicken tenders one I did not know about until our first cruise. And I think that just because we were doing late dining and they really hit the spot, man.

00:29:44.27
Stan Lemon
They do, they do hit the spot.

00:29:43.48
Jon
So yeah.

00:29:45.78
Stan Lemon
i don't want to spoil a meal. So, I made sure I got, I had two chicken tenders on the total of the whole cruise. i had one, two different times. Right.

00:29:56.31
Stan Lemon
But I also know that if John Kohlmeier,

00:29:57.31
Jon
That's interesting. I don't know if I would ever be able to get just one chicken tender.

00:30:01.53
Stan Lemon
well, listen, man, I, I'm a,

00:30:00.95
Jon
So ah kudos to you, man. Yeah.

00:30:05.23
Stan Lemon
my My mantra on this was I'm going to sample everything. right so I did that. I went to the new barbecue place, tried everything that they had to offer, right which that place is pretty awesome.

00:30:17.47
Stan Lemon
and Then i went to the canteen actually a couple times and you know again, sampled sampled that. I went to Marceline, which when we were on The Wish, we have we never went to Marceline because we were staying in concierge and they have a whole different...

00:30:28.27
Stan Lemon
like lunchtime dining setup. Marceline is phenomenal. Marceline is better than Cabana's.

00:30:34.32
Jon
Nice.

00:30:35.50
Stan Lemon
That's my hot take right here on the podcast. Marceline, the Marceline market is better than Cabana's. um

00:30:41.99
Jon
I like it.

00:30:43.28
Stan Lemon
I had coconut shrimp one day that was phenomenal. Um, I had the charcuterie thing i mentioned. I had a chicken marsala at one point.

00:30:54.01
Stan Lemon
I like, I, all kinds of just great stuff. Right. And I went with small portions, tried as much as I could. I did dessert almost every lunch. I had ice cream, John. I had, uh,

00:31:06.07
Stan Lemon
I had ice cream. Like I don't normally get ice cream from the self-serve machines, honestly, because they kind of gross me out. You you got kids like that.

00:31:12.62
Jon
Sure.

00:31:13.49
Stan Lemon
They're like all of them, but on the Triton class, there is there, it's behind the counter and they're served to you. Right. And so, uh, that was like, I just felt, felt better about By the Marceline, everything is served for you.

00:31:20.96
Jon
Ah, nice.

00:31:26.41
Stan Lemon
There's no, like you reach in and scoop around, which also superior in every way, shape and form.

00:31:28.59
Jon
Nice.

00:31:31.44
Jon
Yes.

00:31:32.82
Stan Lemon
Um,

00:31:32.72
Jon
Why? Because people are gross.

00:31:35.63
Stan Lemon
People are very gross, yes. um But I would just say the quality.

00:31:39.86
Jon
How did Henry feel about this? Because I know Henry like really likes to see how how tall can you get the ice cream cone.

00:31:42.26
Stan Lemon
Oh, he hated it. Yeah. Yeah. everything Everything about being served food annoyed him, whether it was a Marceline or elsewhere.

00:31:46.10
Jon
So.

00:31:51.19
Stan Lemon
like It really, really bothered him. um So I did all that. I did room service. I got my hamburger from room service that I love, right? And got my movie theater popcorn with my refills.

00:32:04.63
Stan Lemon
um I ah got a Mickey bar on the last day at lunch, right? Yeah, yeah, I love Mickey.

00:32:09.71
Jon
Nice. But not delivered to your room?

00:32:12.82
Stan Lemon
that delivered to my room because it was a moment of opportunity and I was like, I'm going to go for it. um I went to Enchante for dinner and and brunch. I did not go to Palo, which is fine.

00:32:22.03
Jon
Mm-hmm.

00:32:24.82
Stan Lemon
But I will tell you, Enchante is...

00:32:26.51
Jon
This is Paolo's Steakhouse, too, so I don't know a lot about Paolo's Steakhouse.

00:32:31.15
Stan Lemon
Oh, is it different than the Palo we've been to?

00:32:32.97
Jon
I think it's just extended steak menus.

00:32:36.65
Stan Lemon
Oh, okay. All right.

00:32:36.75
Jon
Like, there's there's other staples and things, but

00:32:39.27
Stan Lemon
I've had phenomenal Wagyu Palo. So, um, and at Remy actually, but anyhow, Enchante was phenomenal. Uh, we, we did the collection one night. We did the Portager the other day and we had the same waiter and, um,

00:32:54.32
Stan Lemon
because we told him upfront that we were gonna come again on the cruise, he actually helped us strategize how to get, you know, the most exposure between the two days.

00:33:04.69
Stan Lemon
And then when I, and we came back out for brunch, his name is Enzo.

00:33:05.14
Jon
That's awesome.

00:33:09.07
Stan Lemon
Enzo from Italy, delightful human being. I mean, absolutely phenomenal. ah

00:33:12.71
Jon
I wonder if he was my Polo waiter once.

00:33:16.72
Stan Lemon
Oh, I don't know. I don't know. Um,

00:33:18.25
Jon
OK.

00:33:19.35
Stan Lemon
All right, so Enzo, though, on the lunch day, asked me if there was anything that i really loved from the collection on the previous day. And i was I told him, like, I had this sirloin Wagyu. It was a non-standard Wagyu cut, and it was just but unbelievably good, right? um And so I told him that, and he was like, well, why don't we substitute the pigeon pie for for that Wagyu today? i was like oh, I can do that? said, of course, why not, right?

00:33:47.22
Stan Lemon
So we did that. And then I told him, I was thinking about ordering a side of the Naki because I really wanted to try the truffle because they had actual truffle, John.

00:33:55.35
Jon
Pause, pause, pause, pause. So you remember the twisties from my work.

00:34:00.50
Stan Lemon
Yes.

00:34:02.13
Jon
They listened to the pasta episode where you pronounced that particular noodle like that. And everybody is up in arms about your pronunciation because it's supposed to be gnocchi.

00:34:13.16
Stan Lemon
Avnaki?

00:34:13.85
Jon
Gnocchi.

00:34:14.67
Stan Lemon
Noki?

00:34:15.41
Jon
And I told them, well, he's learning Italian, so eventually ah will correct itself. So...

00:34:21.17
Stan Lemon
a

00:34:21.01
Jon
ah

00:34:22.67
Stan Lemon
Enzo was very forgiving for all of my Italian pronunciations. I tried i tried my things. Gnocchi. So it was a very delicate French gnocchi, not an Italian gnocchi. And Enzo was, you know...

00:34:33.55
Stan Lemon
um go to He made made that very clear to me, right? But he let me substitute another thing in this Portager menu, and then I got five grams of fresh shaved truffle. So I've had truffle-infused things, but this was like thinly, and I took a picture of it just to show you.

00:34:52.05
Stan Lemon
um

00:34:52.23
Jon
Nice. Yeah.

00:34:53.27
Stan Lemon
And the truffle itself was incredible. They've got this wild contraption that they bring it out. It's this big stone ball. And they open it up and they'll like just show it to you. And it's not a thing they always have.

00:35:04.34
Stan Lemon
um Yeah, it was it was was pretty wild. I did learn that the enchante menu is seasonal. So if you remember on The Wish, we had um a tomato experience. the Like the tomato water. Remember we were talking about that? Like it was just...

00:35:17.04
Stan Lemon
Incredible. They did not have that. They had some other stuff, which good, but I learned that it was seasonal. So I have to go back when they've got the summer menu to get the tomato experience again.

00:35:28.18
Stan Lemon
um But we did a wine pairing one night. We did the champagne pairing another night. And those are fantastic. And the champagne pairing, I had Dom Perignon and I had Cristal, which, you know, like as you as you said on text, right? It reminded me of all of my favorite rap music.

00:35:48.84
Jon
Right. Living that thug life, Stan.

00:35:52.34
Stan Lemon
Living that thug life. Yeah. I got no regrets. I've got no regrets. But like it's good. Enchante is one of those things. it's It's stupid expensive. Like it is not, um not everyone should do it, but everyone should try is what I would say. Right?

00:36:08.91
Jon
So I have not been to any of the French restaurants. so I've never been to Remy. I've not been on the Triton class. and not on t trate I've been to Apollo.

00:36:16.62
Stan Lemon
Remy is so good.

00:36:16.24
Jon
um And like The Apollo food is probably better than anything I've had on land. um The Remy or the Apollo service is definitely better than anything I've had anywhere else.

00:36:31.44
Stan Lemon
Yeah, you're I mean, so the way they advertise Enchante is it's a Michelin star chef, right? And um it's lots of lots of courses.

00:36:37.06
Jon
Mm hmm.

00:36:41.35
Stan Lemon
They're all small. They're very specific. There's a story with each one, right? And if you're interested in the story, then you have a fantastic conversation to go along with it. Same with the wine, Right. And it just so happened that the sommelier that we had at Enchante on the Treasure was our sommelier at Enchante on the Wish.

00:37:00.37
Stan Lemon
And so, you know, they i don't they meet all kinds of people.

00:37:00.71
Jon
ah nice right

00:37:03.89
Stan Lemon
They're not going to write remember me. But I was able to meet the connection. connection And it just, I don't know, man, it makes for a good conversation. It makes for a really good conversation, a really good time. And it's a couple hours of, you know, a truckload of money.

00:37:17.19
Stan Lemon
And just, it's great.

00:37:17.76
Jon
well that's the other thing too is this is a nice leisurely meal too um like it's it's what dining should be stan but we live in america so we're always rushing to the next thing so

00:37:22.42
Stan Lemon
Yeah. Yep. yep

00:37:29.49
Stan Lemon
We live in America, yeah. right, speaking of dining, we should talk about the three restaurants, OK? So on The Wish, there's 1923.

00:37:33.99
Jon
Okay.

00:37:36.78
Stan Lemon
There is the World of Marvel. And then there is the Frozen-themed restaurant. i don't know what it's actually called. On The Treasure, you still have 1923.

00:37:47.06
Stan Lemon
You still have World of Marvel. And then you have Coco. All right? Coco and Frozen are in the same space. They're on deck five. And they're at the very back of the boat. So there are actually windows on the back of this class of ship, and you can look it if you want, right? Now, at night,

00:38:03.44
Jon
And see the Stern character, usually.

00:38:05.81
Stan Lemon
You can see the stern character, yes. And I grabbed a photo of the stern character, which was Captain Hook, um which you can't do any other boat, like from from that that perspective, right? um At night, you're not gonna be able to see out of it. So it's like, it's not it's not great from that perspective, but um it's a super cool like it's a super cool space. And what I would say is the Frozen show was cool. The Frozen food was meh, right? Like they were trying to do a Norwegian style food and I'm sorry, Norwegian food, not interesting. um

00:38:37.33
Stan Lemon
Yeah, write to us, podcast at twistedlemonpod.com with all your complaints. Norwegian food is lame. There, I said it.

00:38:44.69
Jon
But you know, they have fjords, so...

00:38:45.63
Stan Lemon
They have fjords, right? They have fjords. the The one on the treasure is cocoa-themed, and I had not seen cocoa before this cruise.

00:38:54.87
Jon
This is one of the things I most look forward to on the treasure.

00:38:58.74
Stan Lemon
Okay. It is so wicked cool. It is awesome. And the food is phenomenal. So we went Enchante dinner and actually came to Coco afterwards.

00:39:10.96
Stan Lemon
Our kids were there just to catch the show and have chips and salsa, to be completely frank with you. On the second night, they had a wine flight, Tres Reces. I don't know not that right. And

00:39:22.80
Jon
They had a wine flight on the menu.

00:39:24.63
Stan Lemon
A wine flight. They had a wine flight on the menu. So it's this Spanish winery that they have a Sauvignon Blanc, a Tempranillo, and a Calidoc red blend, right?

00:39:27.20
Jon
Wow.

00:39:35.73
Stan Lemon
Tell me you're not intrigued just a bit, right?

00:39:35.63
Jon
Nice.

00:39:38.06
Stan Lemon
Yeah, okay.

00:39:37.27
Jon
I'm very intrigued. There's no way I

00:39:40.08
Stan Lemon
Okay, so it was three three-ounce pours, okay, for $22, which on a cruise ship, for for good glass for good wine, like nine ounces, come on. That's it's great. But what I'll tell you is the Sauvignon Blanc was just fantastic. Lots of minerality and just some stone fruit in there, like nice good complexity. The Tempranillo was everything you love about a Tempranillo. All right, and then then the Caledoc. The Caledoc Red Blend was complex, but gentle.

00:40:12.04
Stan Lemon
Like there was, there were layers on it opened up with, with, um, with time and and,

00:40:17.04
Jon
So it was like a good table wine.

00:40:19.19
Stan Lemon
It was a fantastic table wine. It was so fantastic that I asked my, because again, I'm channeling John Kohlmeyer, right? So what's the, um in this moment, I'm thinking myself, what is the impossible thing that Disney can deliver magically, right? And the impossible thing was, I am sitting in cocoa. This is a cocoa exclusive. I want a bottle of the Caledoc, not tomorrow night, but in two nights when I'm in World of Marvel.

00:40:45.81
Stan Lemon
Right? that's so So I explained this to Vivi and and and she's like, yeah, absolutely.

00:40:47.73
Jon
Tell me they did this for you.

00:40:53.54
Stan Lemon
We'll make it happen. Right? John, I didn't have to remind her.

00:40:57.75
Jon
Oh, no.

00:40:58.58
Stan Lemon
i didn't to her at all. So, we because in the Just to understand, like the next night we were in 1923. 1923 has a very nice wine menu. And I wanted to order something off of that wine menu, because they've got like just a ah wider range of glasses that you can order.

00:41:14.45
Stan Lemon
And then you know we back in the world of marvel Marvel, it's just like the the you know the six or seven standard glasses that they've got floating around. Yeah, John's doing the the little thing. We should talk about the the seating on the but on the plane too. um

00:41:27.12
Jon
Right.

00:41:28.37
Stan Lemon
So yeah, she showed up with the bottle and it was just as good as I remembered. um I, the reason I thought this was plausible was because of the first time we were in 1923.

00:41:41.27
Stan Lemon
I had that morning been to a wine tasting and I've never done a wine tasting on the cruise ship before. I did a, um, a bojito tasting on our Mediterranean cruise in order to see, cause you know there's like that space in one of the smokestacks.

00:41:58.72
Stan Lemon
That's not actually a smokestack. Yeah.

00:41:59.15
Jon
Yeah.

00:42:00.24
Stan Lemon
Yeah. But it's not anymore.

00:42:00.46
Jon
Although now they're like, now they're sweets, right?

00:42:03.19
Stan Lemon
Right, that now they're sweets. So when we were in the Mediterranean, i knew that this boat had not been dry docked and that it had not been converted. And I'd never been up there. And there was a tasting up there. And i don't really care about mojitos. Like, that's not my jam.

00:42:13.71
Stan Lemon
But I thought, oh, we'll go do a mojito tasting so that I can see that space.

00:42:14.36
Jon
Right.

00:42:17.23
Stan Lemon
And so we were up there to just try it out, blah, blah, blah. But that's really the only tasting that we've done other than there's like a juice thing that that Sarah likes to do before we leave, right?

00:42:22.04
Jon
Mm-hmm.

00:42:26.25
Stan Lemon
Which is not done anymore because they got rid of that ah on on the Dream Class too.

00:42:28.99
Jon
Mm-mm.

00:42:31.79
Stan Lemon
Anyhow, we did this wine tasting, and the sommelier from Paula comes down. Her name was Gabriela from Brazil and Portugal. She was delightful. I got pictures of all the bottles, John, but there were there were two that we had that jumped out at me as just spectacular. so The first three were white wines. They were all actually quite good, and she talked about these with i passion and there was a story and she would talk about old versus new and like what was going on. And and there was like a little bit of back and forth about what we were tasting or smelling and so forth.

00:43:06.23
Stan Lemon
It was really good. You would have enjoyed it. So we did we did three whites. They were all spectacular. And then we jumped to the first red and, ah oh, but I should tell you, of the whites, two of them identified by smell before we started.

00:43:20.18
Stan Lemon
You'd be proud.

00:43:20.82
Jon
Nice.

00:43:21.65
Stan Lemon
Yeah. The third one was a rosé, totally,

00:43:23.12
Jon
I don't know if I could do that with whites.

00:43:24.85
Stan Lemon
So totally tripped me up. Well, I listen, I was, I was rocking it. So, uh, first one comes up and I was like, oh that's Peter Noir. And it was, and it was, it was, uh,

00:43:34.86
Jon
Well, that's an easy one to smell.

00:43:37.20
Stan Lemon
Well, I thought so.

00:43:36.74
Jon
So.

00:43:38.16
Stan Lemon
This was this is Pinot Noir called King Estate from Willamette Valley in Oregon, right?

00:43:38.80
Jon
Okay.

00:43:43.22
Stan Lemon
And she talked a little about, you know, Oregon being on the scene and and all of that. um But this one was crazy complex. Like it it was ah had the the funk on the nose, but just lots of layers.

00:43:56.37
Stan Lemon
And um I, at this moment, had decided I was going to have another glass this wine. Now, I thought it was going to be a bottle, but instead, turns out that I grabbed a glass of that while watching Zootopia 2 with the last bottle on the boat that just so happened to be at Preludes. So there you go. um The next one was a Chianti, which I called.

00:44:17.23
Stan Lemon
The third one I thought was a Bordeaux. And it turns out that that's exactly what this this gentleman, Robert Mondavi, was trying to accomplish. And there's this whole like story in the 70s of the competition where he goes toe-to-toe with Bordeaux, and he's the winner, right? um But as it was a cab sav from Napa Valley. And as you know, I don't particularly care for California wines.

00:44:41.43
Stan Lemon
This was so stinking good that when I got to 1923 that night, i i had it on my brain that there's got to be another bottle of this somewhere on the boat. right And so I said, Vivi, can you you know that's our our drink, the assistant server, the Lydia Hilton drinks. like Can you please go ask the sommelier if he can find this Robert Mondavi bottle that I had at the tasting?

00:45:05.23
Stan Lemon
Right? And she went and got him. And he knew exactly what I was referring to because he had actually been at the wine tasting in the morning as well. Right. Tracked it down. And I also channeled my inner Kohlmeyer, decided I would ask if they could decant it for me.

00:45:22.26
Stan Lemon
Right. In this moment, I'm realizing i have never seen a decanter in the dining space at these restaurants. Right. okay So it turns out the only decanters they have are actually up in the rows.

00:45:36.63
Stan Lemon
So someone ran to the opposite end of the boat, both vertically and horizontally, to find me a decanter.

00:45:35.85
Jon
Of course.

00:45:42.58
Jon
Yep.

00:45:43.58
Stan Lemon
It turns out that the decanter could not be washed in the 1923 dish area, think.

00:45:50.50
Stan Lemon
ah you know dish area

00:45:52.69
Jon
They wash him with special water.

00:45:54.67
Stan Lemon
Well, they've got a special machine or something like it's, it's delicate glassware. Right. Uh, so, so she had to take the dirty one back up to the Rose when all was said and done, but fantastic bottle of wine. Uh, and I am determined to find a case of this and to get it.

00:46:11.60
Stan Lemon
That's like, I, I want, I want to have this on my, my wine rack.

00:46:11.84
Jon
Nice.

00:46:15.96
Stan Lemon
Um, So that was that was the wine tasting experience. The champagne tasting experience, same sommelier, just as fantastic, just as fantastic.

00:46:26.35
Jon
But you have less exposure to Champagne.

00:46:29.36
Stan Lemon
I do, but I will say that I tried, let me think now, I i tried 11 different types of champagne on this cruise. not full glasses, mind you, but 11 distinct glasses.

00:46:40.04
Jon
Wow. Sure.

00:46:43.61
Stan Lemon
Cause I went to the champagne tasting and then we did the champagne experience.

00:46:43.83
Jon
Nice. 13.

00:46:47.54
Stan Lemon
Oh, actually, no, I'm sorry. 13, 13 bottles. different bottles.

00:46:51.06
Jon
Nice.

00:46:52.72
Stan Lemon
Yeah. thirteen different bottles

00:46:53.43
Jon
i said

00:46:55.31
Stan Lemon
um

00:46:55.56
Jon
All right. Well, next time um Lemon and John cruise together, i think we kick off the cruise with a glass of champagne.

00:47:06.26
Stan Lemon
i think I think we kick out the the cruise of the glass champagne. I think we also find ourselves, like, all I could think this whole time, i was having a fantastic time with my wife, but I was like, man, I wish Kohlmeier was here for the wine tasting, for the champagne tasting.

00:47:21.97
Jon
So we had scheduled some tastings on that ah cruise just coming out of COVID, um and we ended up canceling them.

00:47:29.87
Stan Lemon
We did, because honestly, it was your fault, first of all. So, yeah, it was your fault.

00:47:34.16
Jon
It was my fault.

00:47:37.18
Stan Lemon
Cause I don't know what I'm doing. Right. I'm like Oh well yeah. Got to fill the time. We'll book all these things.

00:47:39.97
Jon
I've never done a tasting.

00:47:41.75
Stan Lemon
Never did tasting.

00:47:41.21
Jon
So.

00:47:42.99
Stan Lemon
I booked a of things and then we get on the boat and John is introducing me to wine and they were having stories and conversations. it like, well, we need a tasting for? I just want to try another bottle of wine, you know?

00:47:55.22
Stan Lemon
So there you go.

00:47:55.47
Jon
True.

00:47:56.40
Stan Lemon
Um, one of the best bottles of white, by the way, that I had was from, uh, Louis Jadot, which I know you like, you like their burgundy quite a bit. And, uh,

00:48:04.77
Jon
think Everchamberton, yeah.

00:48:06.45
Stan Lemon
Yeah. So, um, try to think what else, what else have I not told you about for the cruise, Jonathan?

00:48:16.08
Jon
Oh, did you accomplish your mission to get something that was memorable from the sweet shop?

00:48:23.67
Stan Lemon
Um, I, I went and got gelato. Uh,

00:48:26.83
Jon
Was it memorable?

00:48:28.91
Stan Lemon
as it was the only gelato that I had on the cruise. Yes. So it,

00:48:32.26
Jon
Well, you've gotten gelato before because I was with you in a vanilla piece, but...

00:48:36.27
Stan Lemon
Yeah, here's here's here's the problem. So having having been to Italy and had gelato repeatedly, it is so much better in Rome than anywhere I've had, at like anywhere, right?

00:48:52.82
Stan Lemon
And so it was fine.

00:48:52.82
Jon
Yep.

00:48:54.94
Stan Lemon
Like it was fine gelato. You you Americans would would be perfectly satisfied with the gelato.

00:49:01.58
Stan Lemon
But put it i don't know. Yeah. It was American gelato. That's that that's all. i'll

00:49:06.06
Jon
But nothing like none of the cupcakes or little cakes ah caught your interest?

00:49:11.25
Stan Lemon
I didn't get any of those. um i was not in need of so of any more sweets, to be honest with you um so with I wanted a gelato. They had, I think I got butter pecan and it was good.

00:49:25.04
Stan Lemon
It was good. It wasn't great. It was good.

00:49:25.80
Jon
Okay.

00:49:27.35
Stan Lemon
Yeah.

00:49:27.74
Jon
All right.

00:49:28.72
Stan Lemon
i will I will say, if you have the chance to go to Rome and try gelato, two things. First of all, you you always get two flavors. That's what they do. Get two different flavors. That's the expectation. You should embrace it. Second, you say cone crema, and you get it with whipped cream on top. right and that's that's like if it's If it's really like on point, they'll they'll do a little biscotti, little cookie on top. But...

00:49:54.13
Jon
There go.

00:49:55.12
Stan Lemon
Yeah. None of that on though and the, on the, on the treasure, excuse me.

00:49:57.68
Jon
Not on the ship.

00:49:59.06
Stan Lemon
Yeah.

00:49:58.32
Jon
OK. Disney has time to improve.

00:50:03.56
Stan Lemon
um

00:50:05.45
Stan Lemon
Yeah. i don't even know what else to tell you. Like it it was, it was a good cruise.

00:50:07.18
Jon
Did you ever find the inflatable course?

00:50:10.12
Stan Lemon
No, I did not. I didn't really like go looking for it.

00:50:11.02
Jon
The credit course? OK.

00:50:12.100
Stan Lemon
It's probably in that indoor gym thing. um There was crawling with kids.

00:50:15.17
Jon
Yep.

00:50:16.85
Stan Lemon
Like I wasn't going to spend a lot of time there, you know? So, yeah. Yeah.

00:50:21.47
Jon
What else? um You weren't outside because the weather was terrible.

00:50:25.65
Stan Lemon
Thank you.

00:50:25.34
Jon
I've heard that the adult pool deck is significantly smaller than Dream Class.

00:50:34.12
Stan Lemon
I don't know that that's true. So there's there's um there's stuff up in the front, which was all sealed off. That actually is reminiscent of what's on the Dream Class. There's a hot tub on the starboard side, and then there's the infinity pool and two hot tubs at the total aft by the cove bar.

00:50:52.04
Stan Lemon
So i actually I actually would dare to say I think there's more by volume, um but there's...

00:50:57.64
Jon
Just not all concentrated.

00:50:59.29
Stan Lemon
It's not all concentrated. And that's kind of the thing with this Triton class, right? So if you go down the kiddie pools, I actually think those pools might be smaller in size than on the Dream class, but there's more of them.

00:51:10.06
Stan Lemon
but There's more small ones rather than a big one. um And yeah like in some respects, that's kind of the deck layout. on on this class.

00:51:20.21
Stan Lemon
Is it better? i don't know. I might get in a pool with a bunch of kids on a Disney cruise. Like that's, that's not happening.

00:51:25.79
Jon
Right.

00:51:27.08
Stan Lemon
There's, you know, there's that like hot tub infinity pool thing that's going on, on what is it Deck 10 on the, on the dream, right? That's like broken half the time or it's got more.

00:51:37.80
Jon
look It's not an infinity pool. They've got ah windows in the bottom, which is kind of creepy. but

00:52:00.92
Stan Lemon
Okay. So it's not an infinity pool like you would think at a beach resort, but if you remember the, the water goes right up to the like edge of deck 10. And then there's a couple of like circles, right.

00:52:14.20
Stan Lemon
That are in the floor that are see-through and you can see those actually four because they overhang.

00:52:16.06
Jon
Right. Yep.

00:52:19.83
Stan Lemon
So, so that none of that's there. That's not on the Triton class at all. The infinity pool at the back of the the ship is adult only. Um, You know, it's, I don't know that there's less. I think there's probably comparable. It's just distributed differently is what I would say.

00:52:40.51
Jon
Okay. All right.

00:52:44.21
Stan Lemon
So.

00:52:44.14
Jon
So where does the treasure rank on the ships you've been on?

00:52:50.10
Stan Lemon
Oh, this is tricky. So the wonder is still my favorite ship. I think i Prefer the dream. My kids vehemently disagree with me on this. We've spent more time on the fantasy at this point, but I'm such a fan of the district that um that really kind of a kind of a downside to me for the fantasy.

00:53:08.62
Jon
What are your kids like about the fantasy that the dream doesn't have?

00:53:13.97
Stan Lemon
ah's What they would tell you is they they think the the styling is like more appealing to them, um but beyond that, they just they love that boat because they spent more time on it.

00:53:22.96
Jon
so they're into the yeah art and way of artistic class.

00:53:26.80
Stan Lemon
Yeah, I guess. i guess, man. I guess.

00:53:28.91
Jon
I would be, i would be completely opposite. So.

00:53:31.95
Stan Lemon
yeah

00:53:32.08
Jon
Okay.

00:53:33.39
Stan Lemon
um So for me, Wonder, probably Dream. Honestly, I think I might actually put The Treasure next and then The Fantasy. That's my hot take for you. i think I think The Treasure has some really great theming and that Coco restaurant between Coco and Enchante.

00:53:49.97
Stan Lemon
ah They are just awesome. I really enjoy both those.

00:53:54.26
Jon
Nice. Cool. Well, I'm glad you had a good trip despite the weather.

00:53:59.89
Stan Lemon
Yeah, you know, I survived, right? I think here's here's the bottom line. So, you know, I can look at it as we we missed two ports. All of our excursions were canceled. ah It was cold, though much warmer than here. It was windy and it rained occasionally. Or I could recognize that it was in fact warmer. I was being pampered. I was not at work and I was far enough away from everything.

00:54:26.12
Stan Lemon
I was able to like really reset and relax. I will say I need to bring more with me to do on the boat. um I started by reading h t Wells' The Time Machine, which I didn't really care for.

00:54:33.72
Jon
Oh,

00:54:38.74
Stan Lemon
And I i really needed a fluff novel.

00:54:39.29
Jon
interesting.

00:54:41.55
Stan Lemon
i but I brought heady reading. So I brought h she Wells' The Time Machine. I brought Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under into the Sea. And then in case I got there, I only made it through half halfway of Jules Verne. I also brought Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee and King Arthur's Court, which didn't didn't get to, but those are all like heady readings compared to, you know, like ah like a nice start yeah right Star Wars fluff novel, right? ah So, you know, that was lesson learned, especially when you have cancellations like that.

00:55:14.45
Stan Lemon
um And i think i've been I've been hesitant to bring my laptop on these trips, but I think I should. I really think I should.

00:55:25.52
Jon
Why is that Stan?

00:55:27.50
Stan Lemon
Well, i' found like i was I've thought a lot about this because I had a lot of time to think about it. um My hobbies, as of late, are... writing code that has nothing to do with work. doesn't even look like the code I write at work.

00:55:41.01
Stan Lemon
And, um I really need my laptop to do that. I did a little bit using my wife's iPad and the codex in the cloud. And I got some stuff done, but not what I wanted to. And it was like slower. And there were some things that I would have liked to been able to like validate or try without having to push up into um a remote system and run it kind of thing. So for me, I think...

00:56:07.25
Stan Lemon
what I need to consider is bringing the laptop and just embracing that I'm going to do stuff with it. That's not work. And then figure out a way to not do adulting with it.

00:56:18.90
Stan Lemon
Right. So don't balance my checkbook. Don't look at my email. Um, that's the, that's the challenge I think I need to sort through that I, I was, I've tried to protect against, but the truth is like, I don't think I should go on this cruise and rest and reset and then ignore my hobbies. Right.

00:56:37.52
Jon
Fair enough. So I'm thinking like you need a good old, ah good deck for all your laptop. And I think that will be more important for you or more impactful for you than back in the day when you would go during a blizzard that shut down the city for a week.

00:56:57.17
Stan Lemon
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, uh, lessons learned opportunities. I am thinking ahead to the next cruise. I've got my eyes set on, uh, the destiny.

00:57:09.20
Stan Lemon
Um, I think at the risk of a flight, that's the next one that's booked.

00:57:12.02
Jon
So next cruise is through Panama Canal, right? And it's it's super long, right?

00:57:16.77
Stan Lemon
Right. But, but it's, it is super long that, but that's the next one that's booked. That's not the next cruise. That's just the next one that's booked. So the the question becomes like, is it is it one or two cruises before Panama?

00:57:31.15
Stan Lemon
I don't know.

00:57:31.41
Jon
When is that? Is that next year or is it?

00:57:33.68
Stan Lemon
Yeah, it's just sometime next year. Yeah. it's like It's like close to summer, right?

00:57:40.30
Jon
I mean, i don't have the PTO that you have, so I was eyeing some five-nighters on my favorite itinerary that stops at both Disney Islands. so

00:57:50.00
Stan Lemon
Well, so like, this is what's been on my mind. Destiny in the fall, Five Night, you know, hit up Castaway Cay and Lighthouse, and then your your finger quotes at Sea Day at Nassau, right?

00:58:03.70
Jon
Right.

00:58:04.56
Stan Lemon
So, yeah, no, was a good trip, John. I'm glad to be back. I will say I've got a lot of catch-up to do on the AI front. I feel like the amount of stuff that happened last week was honestly a little overwhelming to me.

00:58:17.14
Stan Lemon
So, um you know, Xcode's got a whole new agentic mode in the 2.3 beta.

00:58:22.42
Jon
Yep.

00:58:24.98
Stan Lemon
Codex, like Chachupiti released a Codex app for your your Mac, and then they're doing something crazy. They're 2x credits when you use the app until April.

00:58:30.16
Jon
and Okay, so you're saying I need to actually jump on my New Year's resolutions and start coding again?

00:58:41.43
Stan Lemon
I'm just saying, like, now is the time. So far, the app looks super cool. Yeah. Opus 4.6 dropped on the Claude side. It looks looks pretty stellar.

00:58:52.14
Stan Lemon
um the Since I last subscribed to Claude, which honestly was just December.

00:58:58.29
Jon
December.

00:58:59.40
Stan Lemon
Yeah.

00:58:58.73
Jon
Right.

00:59:01.34
Stan Lemon
There's a whole new Apple Health integration, which I started to play with. I'm still on the waiting list for ChatGPT and haven't gotten it. um And, you know, Cursor's done a bunch of things too. Like I honestly, the last week,

00:59:14.74
Stan Lemon
a whole bunch of stuff happened and it all looks super cool. And so I got back. I was like, man, I got, I don't have enough time. I gotta i got to, got to try all this before i go back to work, you know? So I'm going to do some of that and then we'll talk about it i guess when I'm done.

00:59:29.65
Stan Lemon
All

00:59:30.34
Jon
Alright. Sounds like a plan.

00:59:32.98
Stan Lemon
right, my friend, I think ah that's about as good as we can do.

00:59:37.46
Jon
You know what we didn't talk about? How much longer do you want to go? We didn't talk about your hat and how you got it.

00:59:44.89
Stan Lemon
Oh, my Disney Cruise Line hat. We'll save that for next time because that's a story in its own right.

00:59:46.20
Jon
Yep. Alright.

00:59:48.38
Stan Lemon
I think that that requires some um some some setup and hopefully your internet will be fixed by then too.

00:59:56.33
Jon
Here's open.

00:59:57.68
Stan Lemon
ah right, Jonathan. Until next time, my friend.

00:59:59.92
Jon
All right, Stanley. Later. Bye.
