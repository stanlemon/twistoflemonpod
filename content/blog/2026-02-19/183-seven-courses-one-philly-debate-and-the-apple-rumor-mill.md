Dear Listener,

Episode 183 opens with a classic Stan-and-Jon food dispute: chicken "Philly" naming, pizza dough ingredients, and a playful scorecard on who has actually cooked for whom. That banter rolls into a Chicago road-trip recap, including suburban tavern-style pizza and the realities of teaching new-driver confidence in city traffic.

The center of the episode is Stan's Valentine's weekend in Chicago, with a stay at the Drake Hotel and a detailed review of Boka's seven-course Michelin tasting menu. He and Jon break down what made the meal stand out, from service and pacing to how each wine pairing changed bite by bite.

They wrap with a tech segment covering Apple's next event rumors, Siri delays, Vision Pro momentum, and hands-on Codex thoughts for practical AI work. The closing question for listeners: what should Jon cook the next time Stan visits Iowa?

Thanks for listening,

Stan Lemon & Jon Kohlmeier
