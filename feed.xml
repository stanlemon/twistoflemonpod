      <description>Stan returns from a weather-disrupted Disney Treasure sailing and shares what surprised him most about the Triton class design, from crowd flow and deck access to the Cove Cafe tradeoffs. He and Jon dig into Coco and Enchante, compare wine and champagne tastings, and swap stories about Disney&#39;s serv...</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan returns from the Disney Treasure with a mix of gratitude and hot takes. Bad weather wiped out most port plans, but the conversation turns into a practical breakdown of Triton class design: stairwells, crowd flow, dead ends, and why Cove Cafe access felt like a miss compared to older ships. Along the way, they compare the Treasure to Dream, Fantasy, and Wonder, with some surprising rankings.</p>
<p>Food and wine are the real headliners this week. Stan and Jon cover Marceline wins, Coco's standout show-and-menu combo, and Enchante as a full experience worth trying at least once. They swap tasting notes from multiple wine and champagne pairings, including Dom Perignon, Cristal, and a Robert Mondavi bottle that sparked a full Disney magic moment across dining rooms.</p>
<p>The episode closes with future cruise planning and a quick AI-state-of-the-union: Xcode's new agentic mode, Codex on Mac, Claude and Cursor updates, and waiting on ChatGPT's newer integrations.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan and Jon kick things off with a winter weather check-in and cruise daydreaming. They map out Stan's upcoming Disney Treasure itinerary, from a St. Thomas catamaran sail and Tortola beach day to Castaway Cay bike rentals. That quickly turns into a food strategy session: Enchante brunch, Palo dinner debates, late-seating pacing, and the sacred cruise popcorn bucket.</p>
<p>Next up is a night out in Carmel: a Mack McAnally concert at the Palladium, a deeply Italian meal at Ristorante Roma, and Stan's full-on wine ritual, complete with cork inspection and tasting notes. The conversation then pivots to AI: Jon's pro tip is simple—don't ask a model to generate content cold; feed it your raw thoughts and use it as an editor. They wrestle with AI-as-search, junk data, and the surprisingly hard quest for a classy tissue-box riser.</p>
<p>The episode closes with glow-up prompts from the kids, a 2016 photo throwback, and a quick gripe about the iPhone Photos overhaul.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan and Jon open with winter weather and what they're reading right now, from Julius Caesar and Father Brown to Dante's Inferno, Narnia read-alouds, and a fresh Hunger Games installment. Along the way they compare favorite books, illustrated editions, and why some classics still hit harder with time.</p>
<p>They shift into AI workflows and share a simple pro tip: tell ChatGPT (or Claude, or Gemini) to ask you questions one at a time. That turns a vague prompt into a structured interview, which is especially handy for work and life planning. They also touch on Claude's new Co-Work approach, Apple leaning on Gemini, and the appeal of ChatGPT Health tied to Apple Health data.</p>
<p>The back half is a tech frustration parade: HomePod reliability slipping, Siri missing obvious intent, smart bulbs acting up after Thread/Matter changes, and AirPlay feeling worse than it used to. Stan closes with a new Subaru and a better CarPlay experience that finally feels integrated, plus the perennial gripe about Face ID still missing on Macs.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Jon is back from California after a family trip to celebrate his dad's retirement, and Stan reads <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7416463383266340864/">a LinkedIn post</a> that sparked a bigger conversation about vocation, work, and why &quot;follow your passion&quot; can be a misleading north star. They talk about career pivots, using work as a means to support the people you love, and the pressure we put on young adults to pick the &quot;perfect&quot; path too early.</p>
<p>From there, the conversation detours into prompt injection: the risks when AI assistants read the web and can be tricked into doing the wrong thing. Stan and Jon talk about why it's hard to defend against, and how tools like ChatGPT, Perplexity, or browser assistants could be vulnerable.</p>
<p>The back half is all Disneyland. Jon shares the highlights of Long Beach and Newport Beach, a whale watching trip that delivered dolphins but no whales, the magic of a Minnie Mouse encounter, and his evolving relationship with photos and selfies. The food talk returns too: In-N-Out vs Culver's, secret menu fries, and a nod to Chick-fil-A's uncanny consistency.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan and Jon open with Apple Fitness January challenges, with Stan chasing a 14-day exercise goal and Jon staring down a 24-day stand ring. That leads to a quick conversation about competitiveness, board games, and the intensity of Euchre players.</p>
<p>Stan shares why he has switched from Claude to Codex for his iOS side projects, noting better outputs and the value of forced checkpoints that keep runaway automation in check. They invite listeners to the TestFlight beta for Stan's wine tasting app and talk about personal site updates, WordPress hosting costs, and the perils of running multiple AI coding sessions at once.</p>
<p>From there, Stan recaps a quick Pittsburgh trip and a stop at Oakmont Bakery, celebrating how it has scaled up without losing quality. The episode closes with a deep dive on pasta: al dente technique, fresh noodles, favorite shapes, and why bucatini takes the crown.</p>

      <title>On Taste and Truffles</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Welcome to 2026! This is our first episode of the new year, and Stan and Jon kick things off by talking about New Year's plans. Jon is heading to Disneyland in Southern California with his family on January 3rd, while Stan is eager to hear if the experience lives up to Disney World.</p>
<p>Jon shares his Christmas cooking adventure: a dry-brined, convection-roasted chicken guided by ChatGPT. The conversation takes an unexpected philosophical turn when Stan poses an existential question about truffles. Why is a chocolate truffle called a truffle when truffle oil comes from mushrooms? Jon's compartmentalization strategy (chocolate = truffle, savory = mushroom truffle) proves more effective than Stan's ethereal floating-through-truffle-space approach.</p>
<p>Stan gives LinkedIn Premium a resounding two thumbs down, finding little value in the $40/month subscription for someone not actively job hunting. The discussion expands to social media algorithms broadly, with Instagram earning rare praise for actually surfacing interesting content (Lord of the Rings memes, woodworking, Pilates), while LinkedIn's algorithm serves up antagonistic clickbait and irrelevant tech posts. Stan also rants about ChatGPT's desktop app inexplicably hiding group chats.</p>
<p>The meat of the episode explores &quot;taste&quot; as a topic suggested by ChatGPT itself. Stan pulls out a 2014 book on architectural proportions to argue that some things are objectively beautiful based on geometry and natural ratios. They discuss how taste in code has evolved: Stan has become more tolerant of organizational differences but more militant about test coverage. The key insight? Good taste means building products that are easier for customers to use than they are for developers to build. Exposure to real customers through support rotations, sales calls, and advisory boards is the fuel that develops taste in product teams. As Stan puts it, &quot;The voice of the customer is the cocaine for software engineering.&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>It's day twenty-two of the Wall Street Journal Wine Advent Calendar, and Stan and Jon are tasting a French Pinot Noir called Le Champs d'Etoilesse (the field of stars). The wine delivers a pale ruby color with high tannins, funky Pinot character, and notes of blackberry, cherry, and baking spices. After an hour of air, the tannins remain prominent but the smokiness mellows into something quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>The conversation takes a nostalgic turn as Stan recommends The Verge's new podcast &quot;Versions,&quot; specifically the episode about AOL Instant Messenger. The hosts reminisce about their AIM screen names (Tetro4, Trekker1701, DunklerGeist07, and various iterations), crafting the perfect away message with Dashboard Confessional lyrics, and that iconic door sound when someone signed off. They discuss how AIM shaped internet culture and spawned everything from buddy lists to modern Slack.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2026, Stan shares his approach to goals this year: separating hobbies (reading, guitar, coding), habits (exercising, devotions), and actual goals. He's taking up running just to fill in the one missing trend in Apple Fitness, starting a gratitude journal at Mrs. Lemon's suggestion, and considering a return to bread baking. The biggest goal? Improving work-life balance by learning to leave work stress at work. Jon's brilliant suggestion: have Mrs. Lemon rate Stan's post-work mood daily in a vibe-coded &quot;jerk-o-meter&quot; app.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>It's day sixteen of the Wall Street Journal Wine Advent Calendar, and tonight Stan and Jon are sipping an Argentine Malbec called Bracero from the San Juan region. The wine opens with earthy notes (Stan says grass, Jon disagrees), develops into blackberry and chocolate mid-palate, and proves to be an approachable three-star sipper that would work well for company.</p>
<p>The chocolate pie debate rages on! A listener email from Emily (one of Jon's coworkers who has dubbed herself a &quot;Twistie&quot;) sparked a deep dive into dessert taxonomy. Stan conducted a 12-person survey at work where nobody had ever had chocolate pie, researched recipes from America's Test Kitchen to Alton Brown, and emerged with a nuanced position: chocolate pie with flour is basically a brownie in a pie crust, while pudding-based chocolate pie gets a pass. The question of whether all cake must be baked remains philosophically unresolved.</p>
<p>The conversation shifts to the Golden Globes' new podcast category (where's 99% Invisible?), OpenAI's new image generation competing with Google's Nana Banana, and a delightful tangent about ranking Lord of the Rings characters. Spoiler: Eowyn wins for Men of Rohan, Galadriel dominates the elves, and the dwarves need more research. Also, Stan definitely knows what Twitch is.</p>

<p>It's day seven of the Wall Street Journal Wine Advent Calendar, and tonight Stan and Jon are sipping a French Cabernet Sauvignon called Bella Roche while discussing everything from wine legs to label scanning mishaps in Stan's wine tasting app. Pro tip: apparently you should decant these little bottles for an hour, which they definitely did not do.</p>
<p>Jon reveals his 2026 goals, themed around &quot;clarity.&quot; The highlights: reading four Shakespeare plays (Julius Caesar, Othello, King Lear, and The Tempest), being intentional about family time, writing more words, contributing more code to GitHub, and making time for pipe smoking as meditation. Stan commits to reading the Shakespeare plays alongside Jon and challenges him to schedule at least four date nights with Mrs. Kohlmeier.</p>
<p>The conversation takes a fascinating turn into AI philosophy, specifically the difference between ChatGPT's cheerleader personality and Claude's more critical approach. Stan shares how Claude called out his &quot;sodium bomb&quot; lunch while ChatGPT would have just encouraged him. They explore why most AI models are trained to be sycophantic and whether that's actually what users want - or just what they think they want.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

      <description>Dear Listener,
In this episode, we kick things off with a mystery: why did Jon unfriend Stan on Facebook?

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>In this episode, we kick things off with a mystery: why did Jon unfriend Stan on Facebook? Turns out it was an inbox zero situation gone wrong, which leads us into Stan's philosophy on &quot;lists vs buckets&quot; - a productivity mindset shift from being a meticulous list-walker to becoming a free-flowing bucket person.</p>
<p>We recap our Thanksgiving experiences: deep-fried turkey vs smoked turkey, store-bought pie vs homemade rhubarb with lattice top (temped to perfection, of course), and the eternal debate over whether Cheesecake Factory cheesecake counts as a Thanksgiving dessert.</p>
<p>As we approach the new year, we dive deep into habits vs goals. Stan shares his habit-tracking journey from reading 15 minutes daily to his two-and-a-half year streak of morning Apple Fitness Plus workouts. Jon points out that Stan's self-discipline is &quot;pretty rare&quot; - though Stan insists he's not a fitness nut, just someone who doesn't want to die young.</p>
<p>Finally, we resurrect the wine tasting app project with help from Claude, just in time for the Wall Street Journal wine advent calendar. If you want to join us as a TestFlight user, reach out!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>In this special Thanksgiving bonus episode, we tackle the most important question of the holiday season: what makes Thanksgiving truly Thanksgiving?</p>
<p>Stan argues that pie - not turkey - is what defines the holiday. Nobody sits down and says &quot;yum, turkey's my favorite,&quot; but pie? That's what we're all really here for.</p>
<p>We debate the merits of various pies (rhubarb reigns supreme for Stan, with pumpkin as a solid backup), discuss whether chocolate pie and cheesecake pie are actually pies or cakes in disguise, and take a firm stance on lattice tops versus crumble crusts. We also settle the age-old question: are McDonald's apple pockets actually pies? (Spoiler: they're delicious, but no.)</p>
<p>Jon learns that Stan has a deep freezer primarily dedicated to frozen rhubarb for pie-making purposes, and we both agree that calling things by their proper names matters - even if it doesn't change how delicious they are.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving, and may your pie be plentiful.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we dive deep into the AI wars with Google's new Antigravity IDE hitting the scene. Stan walks through his experience testing this VS Code-based editor with built-in agent capabilities that can actually resize browser windows, detect UI issues, and iterate on fixes autonomously.</p>
<p>We compare the big three AI coding assistants - ChatGPT's Codex, Claude, and Gemini Code Assist - and discuss how each is positioning itself in the developer tools space. Jon shares a cautionary tale about Codex going completely off the rails with an overly complex canonical URL solution, reminding us all that you need to be skilled enough to validate AI-generated code.</p>
<p>In a move that shocked his entire family (his daughter thought it was a terminal illness announcement), Stan purchased his first Windows PC in years. We talk about the nostalgia of his first coding laptop with an AMD Athlon 4 processor, and his curiosity about Windows Subsystem for Linux and modern Windows development workflows.</p>
<p>Plus, we kick off the episode with an emergency strap wrench situation involving a jar of filthy cherries that nearly derailed Manhattan night.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening and we'll talk to you soon,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

<p>In this first episode back after our hiatus, we dive into software subscriptions, AI-powered tools, and the ever-quickening pace of the tech world. Stan shares his experience juggling services like Claude, ChatGPT, and Grammarly, and what it’s like trying to manage so many overlapping tools. Jon talks about his AI workflows, including how he uses them for his annual resume refresh and building a master version that ties everything together. We’re both excited about how modern platforms make it easier than ever to experiment, iterate fast, and bring creative ideas to life.</p>

<p>Jon made another trip to Indianapolis for a couple of days with the primary objective of kegging the beer that was brewed over the 4th of July weekend.</p>
<p>Stan managed to plan a bunch of other fun stuff like trimming trees, spreading fertilizer, eating, smoking meat, and eating some more. Of course we had to work in some cycling and tennis to burn off some of those extra calories.</p>
<p>Listen in to hear all about it and tune in next week to celebrate our 150th episode!</p>

<p>Jon also helped Stan pick out a new mower. He had some trouble with the first one, but was able to exchange it for a mower that everyone can be happy with.</p>

<p>In this episode we review Jon's visit to Stan in Indianapolis. All core tenants of the podcast were observed: Meat, Milkshakes, Macs, and Mixology (And Marvel but we don't talk about that until the post-credit scene.). Listen in, it was a fun time together after not seeing each other in person for the first time in 19 months.</p>
<p>We also talk about some announcements including the trailer for the Many Saints of Newark and the new Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p>Jon is recording from Louisville and will be visiting Stan on the way back. We do some research into what constitutes &quot;Kentucky food&quot; and settle on bourbon.</p>
<p>Stan has been getting tweets from LG about his LG Ultrafine review from a couple months ago. We'll have to wait and see if he'll turn into the next spokesperson.</p>
<p>Finally we review the <a href="https://amzn.to/3hgZInc">HidrateSpark Steel</a> water bottle. Both Stan and Jon got one recently and have mixed feeling about it.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we speculate about the Apple WWDC invite and what announcements might be coming at the June event. After that we find out that Stan uses Apple Health far more than any of us knew.</p>
<p>From there we find out that Stan also has an overly complicated schedule on his Ecobees.</p>
<p>Finally, Jon complains about streaming services and having to subscribe to 6 of them just to be able to watch what he wants.</p>

<p>Stan also talks about his twitter adventure with Johnsonville and Oscar Mayer.</p>
<p>August Derecho repairs continue and Jon is starting to see the light at the end of tunnel. When those are over the next project will probably be to move away from the Alexa ecosystem.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we have a first in the history of the podcast. Three people recording from three different states. Last week's Disney announcements at their virtual Investor Day left only one person in our mind who could help us do it justice. None other than our friend and yours, Patrick Sturdivant.</p>
<p>We cover the plethora of Marvel announcements, Star Wars announcements, and many of the other things.</p>
<p>This episode, might not be for anyone other than diehard Marvel fans, but it's lots of high quality content for your enjoyment.</p>
<p>Patrick wanted us to note that he made an error when talking about Dr. Strange - Nightmare, reportedly, is the villain in Dr. Strange.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon, Jon Kohlmeier &amp; Special Guest Patrick Sturdivant</p>

      <description>Iowa Twist of Lemon Bunker after tree fell on it during the derecho storm.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://twistoflemonpod.com/content/blog/2020-08-20/tree-on-house.jpg" alt="Iowa Twist of Lemon Bunker after tree fell on it"></p>
<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>After some quick followup on Aldi and their lack of maraschino cherries, we get into why we missed last week's episode.</p>
<p>Eastern Iowa looks like a war zone. Cedar Rapids has lost at least 50% of its tree canopy. The Iowa Twist of Lemon bunker was hit by a tree after straight line winds that reached speeds equivalent to a Category 4 Hurricane. This resulted in Jon being without power for 151 hours. There are still over 20,000 people without power as of posting this episode a week and a half after the storm hit.</p>
<p>Listen in to hear Jon's experience during the storm and the week after it hit and start working on his three helpful things to make it through natural disaster.</p>
<p>1.) Find a friend like Stan Lemon. 2.) Have a sizable emergency fund for the unexpected. 3.) Trust in the Lord who is continually more helpful than governments.</p>
<p>Recovery will be a long process both at the Iowa bunker and in Eastern Iowa. We'll keep you updated as we repair and rebuild.</p>
<p>Finally Stan wants to talk about Fortnite and Apple and the App Store. Jon doesn't know much about what is going on, but Stan has strong feelings.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>
<p>If you haven't yet please subscribe using your favorite podcast app and we'll be back next week! (Barring any natural disasters).</p>

<p>Well.. we're back. If you couldn't tell from the last episode, we ran out of things to talk about back in March.</p>
<p>In this episode we return to discuss all things WWDC 2020. OS updates for the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Watch. Firmware updates for the AirPods. Cool new tech and perhaps the biggest announcement Apple using it's own silicone in future Macs.</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning back in. If you have anything you want to hear us discuss let us know by visiting <a href="https://twistoflemonpod.com/contact/">the contact page</a>.</p>
<p>We'll catch you next week.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>&quot;Boneless&quot; Thugs N Harmony is making a promo video for Buffalo Wild Wings. We talk about Bone Thugs-N-Harmony Stan's history with BW's and why you can probably make better wings at home.</p>
<p>No sound bite from Fenker for this week, but Stan has a pretty good excuse for why he couldn't make it happen.</p>
<p>Stan has a post-Disney shoe update for us. He seems happier with them now that they've been broken in.</p>
<p>Finally, Stan has started prepping. He's now ready to survive a Zombie apocalypse or mutant strains of coronavirus.</p>

<p>Stan has a lot of questions for the LWATOL resident Iowan following the fallout this week from the Caucuses. Now's your chance to get a nickel look into what exactly the Iowa caucuses are.</p>

<p>Stan has some great insights into Mastering Minimalism when it comes to paper.</p>

<p>Stan did not pay any attention to the Jeopardy! Greatest of all Time tournament, but Jon was very excited about it.</p>
<p>We follow up on the ad blocker discussion from last week.</p>
<p>The conversation degrades a bit as Stan complains about his shoe buying process.</p>
<p>From Jon's point of view the conversation gets much better when Stan tells him that he recently finished The Hobbit - even if he didn't like it that much. (Make sure you listen to the bonus round today!)</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We kick off the episode talking about Manhattans which turns into a Milkshake check-in.</p>
<p>We review and comment on some listener comments. Angie left a comment with some suggestions for our 2020 resolutions/goals.</p>
<p>Stan continues his trend of getting rid of things that no longer bring him joy. He gave up his old faithful Mac Mini that he's had since 2011.</p>
<p>Stan wants to know if I use an ad blocker. Stan recommends Ghostery.</p>
<p>Jon also got a new router! Stan hasn't said anything for the last month and half, so Jon had to bring it up.</p>
<p>We wrap up by talking about what we're watching.</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Happy 2020! We kick of this episode recapping what our 2019 goals/resolutions were. Stan went back to listen to what we talked about a year ago.</p>
<p>Jon appears to have crushed his goals while Stan was non-committal in setting any. He did read 40 books this year and he paid off his mortgage.</p>
<p>For 2020 -</p>
<p>Jon plans to read at least 5 days a week and draw better boundaries between work and personal time.</p>
<p>Stan is sitting in a pretty good spot. Perhaps his resolution is to have less strong opinions. He also might try to get on the bike some more. Jon suggests that he writes more.</p>
<p>We hope that you have a great 2020.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We're back after our first week off since we first started Life with a Twist of Lemon. Stan and Jon were hanging out, but not recording. You get a small taste of what we did in Indianapolis.</p>
<p>That kicks off the discussion on the importance of taking a break. Stan yells at Jon for being notoriously bad for this. We talk about how we unwind and mostly ignore work when we aren't working.</p>
<p>From there we move on to productivity. Stan reiterates his view of work when you work and don't work when you're not working. He draws strong boundaries between different areas of life.</p>
<p>We break productivity down into 3 things.</p>
<ol>
<li>How to decide what to do.</li>
<li>Deciding when you're going to do it.</li>
<li>Handling everything that you're not going to do.</li>
</ol>
<p>By definition there can only be one #1 priority. If there's not you're running between things and having decided and committed on what to do.</p>
<p>We dive into how to set priorities and how we do it.</p>
<p>Finally, Stan gives us an update on his Netflix subscription and what he's watching.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

<p>Stan is experimenting with Catalina again, he's running it on a separate partition. Not ready to commit to a full update yet.</p>
<p>Stan is also looking for snow new snow boots. He has an ad hoc Life Tip, boots are important for dry feet in the snow. As with most things Stan has very strong opinions on snow boots.</p>
<p>Mastering Minimalism: Don't buy single-use kitchen appliances. If you want to be minimalistic, take a look at the kitchen items that you use each week. And get rid of everything else that you don't use on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Against Jon's better judgment, They talk about when add-ons make Mac and cheese a casserole. Much like the Grilled Cheese conversation, the criteria are all based on if anything overpowers the named ingredient.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we have feedback from a listener who lives in Montana. she paints the picture of a beautiful state which gets us talking about the most beautiful places that we have visited. Ultimately Stan decides that places can be beautiful and still &quot;nowhere.&quot;</p>
<p>We make it through some other listener feedback from after the last episode.</p>
<p>This week's life tip is to bring a washcloth with you when you travel. Stan gives us the reason why.</p>
<p>Today's Mastering Minimalism tip is &quot;Don't buy books.&quot; Jon and Stan have some words and different views on this.</p>
<p>Stan has been watching Apple TV+ since its release. He gives a brief review of what he's seen.</p>
<p>Finally, we talk about Twitter's recent policy change to not run political ads anymore. This is in contrast to how Facebook follows</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in again this week. We start off the episode talking about Kansas. Stan doesn't back down from Kansas being &quot;nowhere&quot; as he shares his definition of nowhere. We discuss how there are things to do in Kansas, just nothing that Stan would want to do.. except visit a presidential library.</p>
<p>We have a life tip this week from Stan - Don't stop at roundabouts. There's a lot of anger behind this life tip. Listen in, take it to heart and don't do anything stupid.</p>
<p>We have a minimalist tip again this week. Today we focus on the wallet. Jon cleans out his wallet as Stan talks about what little he carries on him.</p>
<p>Finally, you can hear what we said about Game 7 of the World Series just before it aired. Turns out the good guys won!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>If you have any topics that you'd like us to cover, let us know on social media or through our contact form.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We're back in the recording studios after a couple weeks off with Stan traveling. We kick off the episode talking about the World Series.</p>
<p>Jon thinks our Marie Kondo episode changed his life. He started purging everything that hasn't sparked joy. Social Media Followers, Books, clothes. Stan has started reading the book, he's not overly impressed and probably won't finish it.</p>
<p>Stan has a Life Tip in this episode. We find a theme song, and learn a good way to keep track of car maintenance. If you have a tried and true method, let us know.</p>
<p>That leads in to his recent road trip to visit occasional listener Aaron Fenker (of Meat Rubs by Fenker) who lives in Kansas.</p>
<p>We have a quick lightening round where we follow up on things that we've covered in past episodes. Stan's MacBook, Jury Duty, Jon's basement, screentime, milkshakes, resume.</p>
<p>Finally we have the final trailer for Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker. We talk about that a little and Stan already has tickets.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan has been on a purging spree. He's thinking about reading the Marie Kondo book and taking this to a whole new level.</p>
<p>That's actually the main topic of this episode, but somehow we touch on modern art, Andy Warhol, white space in design.</p>
<p>Ultimately this is a long talk about minimalism and cutting waste.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week you get the episode that we recorded fo last week… so there's some weird stuff with October and Oktoberfest. Don't let it deter you, the episode is still awesome.</p>
<p>Someone asked Stan what our podcast was about… now we're going through an existential crisis.</p>
<p>Jon has been tackling a home improvement project, he's not sure what color to point the wall of the future Iowa Life with a Twist of Lemon Studio. He also did some electrical work recently. Stay tuned for updates in the future.</p>
<p>Jon also pretended to be an extrovert and attended the first Cedar Rapids Tech Crawl, where they visited different tech companies that have their homes in the NewBo district (where Jon works too).</p>
<p>Stan got summoned for Jury Duty - I guess we'll have to stay tuned to see if he gets put on a jury.</p>
<p>Stan has some computer woes and will likely be sending his laptop in for some repairs. Can we record only on an iPad? Will Stan survive? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Finally we talk about the new Zac Brown Album - The Owl. We aren't really fans. But we spend some time talking about why we aren't fans.</p>
<p>Kind of all over the place this week, but we think it's a good time. Thanks for sticking with us!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We started recording to try to get ahead before Stan's upcoming travels. Turns out the episode we recorded for next week was very time sensitive as we talk about Post-Season baseball.</p>
<p>Listen in to our take on this years October baseball. We also discuss the dismissal of our teams managers Clint Hurdle from the Pirates and Joe Madden from the Cubs.</p>
<p>Definitely a sportsball focused episode but we'll be back next week with our normal discussing topics all over the place.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening and we hope you'll leave a review.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan is trying to figure out what kind of headphones to buy. September is turning out to be expensive for him due to the tech toy purchases.</p>
<p>In the mission to try and review milkshakes and weird menu items (like the impossible whopper.) Jon felt the need to order Pizza Hut's new Stuffed Cheeze It pizza. In the end it's probably worth trying.. but Jon won't order again.</p>
<p>To burn of the extra calories Stan and Jon have been doing lawn work. We talk about the next steps for Jon's lawn and Stan's recent lawn woes.</p>
<p>There's been an increase of use in paper organizers. Stan seems to think it's nostalgia for the old school trapper keepers.</p>
<p>We talk about iOS 13, introduce Stan to the measure app and talk about how Stan is liking his new apple devices.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This turned out to be a sort of catch up in the life of Jon and Stan episode. Stan is having some football woes which leads to a lament to kick off the episode.</p>
<p>Stan didn't add a lot to our list of talking points. So Jon added random things including an EcoBee update, reading updates and bicycling updates.</p>
<p>There's also considerable talk of fire in this episode, Jon's lesson learned while grilling, what kind of gas can he should buy and more.</p>
<p>Finally we talk about prioritization and queuing.</p>
<p>Listen in - let us know if you have ideas for us to talk about.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We're bummed that Jon's sister Liz is no longer a regular listener. We're not sure when exactly she stopped listening. So this week no Star Wars, Marvel or Salesforce talk. We even talk about a topic specifically requested by Liz.</p>
<p>Most of Jon's family came to visit for Labor Day weekend. You'll get a brief update on that weekend and how Jon handles people as an introvert.</p>
<p>We discuss why Stan gave Cal Newport's Digital Minimalism only 2 stars (not the 5 that you should give us on iTunes.) Listen in to why Stan went with that review.</p>
<p>We talk about Stan's computer woes - specifically around Catalina. Stan is back up and running. Things might even be backed up by now.</p>
<p>Finally we clear the topic backlog by talking about our work station. Listen in to how Stan and Jon keep up their desks organized and what are regularly on it.</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan spent the week in Atlanta so Jon wasn't sure if they were going to have anything to talk about. Jon planned a couple items of discussion but then all the news dropped out of D23 (which you may or may not care about, but we do.)</p>
<p>We're excited about Ewan McGregor's return to the role of Obi-Wan Kenobi. The upcoming Mandalorian series. We touch on some other D23 announcements.</p>
<p>Next up we talk about The Rise of Skywalker trailer that dropped this week. Stan didn't get rick-rolled like he was expecting, but overall the trailer doesn't tell us much about the movie.</p>
<p>Then we get to one of Jon's topics - Email best practices.<br>
Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use an appropriate Subject Line</li>
<li>Respond within one business day.</li>
<li>Make clear requests for next actions</li>
<li>Your email should be highly skim-able.</li>
<li>Don't add too many people to the email.</li>
</ul>
<p>Listen in and share some of your email tips!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our meat alternative experiments aren't over yet. Stan bought and grilled up some Beyond Beef. He has a report for us this week. It sounds like Stan might try to try a beyond taco when he's in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Next up we talk Tacos. Beef choice, tortilla choice, cheese, and more. There is way to much talk of Taco Bell in this episode - our apologies to our taco purist friends.</p>
<p>This week Stan wrote a blog post about what we can learn about budgeting from the NFL. The NFL Players association released talking points on budgeting in preparation for an impending lockout. Overall, we think these things are really good advice for all people.</p>
<p>Jon's mortgage contact reached out to see if he was interested in refinancing. Does it make sense less than a year after he bought his house? Stan asks some inquisitive questions to arrive at a recommendation for Jon.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>

<p>Happy 47th birthday to Jon's father-in-law, Rev. Mark Buetow!</p>
<p>Stan got notified about the Apple Card, he seems so excited about it that he thought Jon was too.</p>
<p>We did something impossible to our bodies in the past week. Both Stan and Jon made trips to Burger King Stan ate a Whopper and an Impossible Whopper. Jon just opted for the impossible whopper.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we finally talk Euchre! Turns out Stan doesn't know how to play.</p>
<p>Jon's boss is out of the office this week, so Jon's in charge! That leads into us talking about opening our own e-commerce store complete with lemonade glasses. Stan doesn't like the idea of a tornado shaped lemonade glass.</p>
<p>Jon went to Five Guys and did not have a great experience. The burger cooks didn't value craftsmanship as much as we do here at Life with a Twist of Lemon.</p>
<p>Because our dear friend Crysten did not understand any of the Star Trek banter, this week we decide to talk about resumes.</p>
<p>Stan talks about some to dos and not dos for what to include on a resume. Where his resume has been and what the current format is.</p>
<p>This turns into one of those practical advice episodes that everyone likes so much. So stick through the early part of the episode to hear the Lemon drop some wisdom.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Welcome to season 2 with a twist of Lemon. Stan starts off with a new season resolution to find Jon a new router. Will this be the year that burger reviews take the place of milkshake reviews?</p>
<p>Stan has been having an existential crisis of whether we continue the podcast or not.</p>
<p>We have a new review! Thanks Angie for the review on iTunes.</p>
<p>Jon has a dream where his wife, Anna and Stan's wife Sara become the best of friends. He nudged it a little bit this week but pushing for a phone call.</p>
<p>To round out the episode Stan and Jon talk about the upcoming Star Trek series Picard.</p>
<p>Finally, Endgame is out! Stan has been working his way through the rewatch.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Rejoice with us as we celebrate our first year of podcasting as Life with a Twist of Lemon!</p>
<p>To kick it off Stan wants to talk about the Marvel Phase 4 announcements. Don't let that stop you from making it through to the reminiscing on the last year. (Skip to 11 minutes if you're so inclined).</p>
<p>We talk about how the podcast came to be, some of our favorite parts of the last year, and some of our listeners favorite parts!</p>
<p>Milkshakes, Marvel, Jon buying a house, the great Grilled Cheese controversy, and other random things that stood out.</p>
<p>Thanks for wasting spending the last year with us. If you feel so inclined please leave a five-star review on iTunes.</p>
<p>Stay Sour, friends,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We're getting closer to our 1 year anniversary.. but not quite there yet. Which is a blessing in disguise because Stan isn't completely on board with Jon's idea yet.</p>
<p>We follow up last week where we question the accessibility of the Touch Bar. Turns out the Touch Bar is extremely accessible. See the link in the show notes below. This leads into an overall Accessibility discussion.</p>
<p>Then we switch into the week's big news: Amazon Prime Day. This year Prime Day was a two day event. Both Jon and Stan took part in this years Prime Day.</p>
<p>This leads into a video that Jon sent over to Stan on Elizabeth Warren breaking up big tech.</p>

      <description>We have a jam-packed episode today. All the potential of a great anniversary episode but we are still not at one year of Life with a Twist of Lemon.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We have a jam-packed episode today. All the potential of a great anniversary episode but we are still not at one year of Life with a Twist of Lemon.</p>
<p>To kick off the episode Jon had a couple of milkshakes on his trip. The first from Hubbard Avenue Diner with a strong showing. Their claim to fame is pie though.. so we talk about that a little bit too. Second milkshake was custard based from Oscars' in West Allis, WI. This was a less great custard milkshake.</p>
<p>Is this the end of Stan's Router Woes? He has a new TP-Link router that he's happy with so far.</p>
<p>Jon and Mrs. Kohlmeier spent some time this past weekend traveling and taking in the sites of Spring Green, WI. They Toured Frank Lloyd Wright's estate, Taliesin, and saw a performance of Macbeth at American Players Theatre.</p>
<p>New Mac news this week. We spend some time talking about 3D Touch and the new changes to the MacBook lines. That leads into a brief discussion on the MacBook Touch Bar.</p>
<p>Finally we close out the episode with a review of Spider-Man: Far From Home. Stan loved it. Jon went in with higher expectations. We drop spoilers. So if you haven't seen it, stop listening before we ruin it for you!</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening! Leave a review on iTunes if you're so inclined.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan ran into some interesting people in Indianapolis, at Wylipalooza of all places. But he didn't get a milkshake.</p>
<p>Stan is disappointed that we reached Episode 52 but we haven't been doing this for a year quite yet. We'll have a full on celebration here in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Stan did pay off his mortgage in the last week, we're curious what he's going to do next.</p>
<p>Apple has been in the news a couple of times recently, most notable for the departure of Jony Ive. We reflect on what he's done for Apple and wonder what will happen moving forward.</p>
<p>Another core tennant of the podcast is Marvel. So we talk about going to see Spider-Man far from Home and other things Marvel.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We kick off this week's episode with a philosophical discussion on how Jon eats an ice cream Sunday. It doesn't quite reach the level of the great Grilled cheese debate of 2019, but it might get there.</p>
<p>Stan's WiFi woes aren't quite over. The Orbi setup sounded better than it panned out to be and Stan has since returned them and is back to the old router. He's found some cool tools and best practices for optimal WiFi coverage.</p>
<p>There are other things that have happened in the last week that have made Stan grumpy. Ultimately, I think it comes down to talking to too many customer support reps without resolution to his problems. Listen in to hear who he talked to and how each interaction went.</p>
<p>We discuss why personal banking is broken and why Stan is trying to streamline his finances.</p>
<p>Stan installed the Catalina beta, hear some of his initial reactions.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we talk about Stan's Vacation to Traverse City. He seems to have a restful time and even has a review of a milkshake IPA. We're wondering if Deaconess Longmire listens to the podcast.</p>
<p>Stan must have been relaxed because he did some coding for fun!</p>
<p>Jon's life is full once again! He has an Task management app back on his laptop! Microsoft To-Do Released their Mac app this week. And it's really solid.</p>
<p>Amazon pushed marketing for the Kid specific Echo for things like reading stories and asking questions. Jon's curious and asks Stan what his thoughts are on devices like this and kids and devices in general.</p>
<p>Stan suggests Jack Ryan as a show to watch. We still aren't sure where he finds time to watch all this stuff.</p>
<p>We talk about our Libra - the cryptocurrency that Facebook is now involved in.</p>
<p>Finally, We talk about Stan's new network equipment the NetGear Orbi. He's also starting to consider new headphones.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Last week, Jon had an idea for a discussion topic - What makes a good meeting. So that's what we spend the majority of this episode talking about.</p>
<p>Stan is also headed on vacation this week, he gives a little preview of what he'll be up to.</p>
<p>Stan lays out 3 types of meetings.</p>
<ol>
<li>Trying to Find Something Out (Receive Information)</li>
<li>Trying to Explain Something (Share information)</li>
<li>Trying to Collaborate.</li>
</ol>
<p>Listen in as we take a not very organized approach to talking about meetings, what meetings should have, and some things that throw them off course.</p>
<p>That leads into a brief discussion on actual productivity vs. productivity theatre. In general we conclude that &quot;productivity theatre&quot; tries to address a symptom rather than the core problem.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>

<p>Today is Mrs. Lemon's birthday! Happy birthday Mrs. Lemon! Thanks for taking care of Stan.</p>
<p>No new reviews this week. Which means you, dear listener, should leave us a review.</p>
<p>Stan christened his brand new meat smoker over the weekend. Listen in as Stan talks about his experience with the smoker and how it all turned out.</p>
<p>We're both Star Trek fans so we can't let the new trailer for the new Picard series. We talk about lots of things Star Trek and how we're excited about Patrick Stewarts return to Captain Picard.</p>
<p>WWCD is coming up. Stan gives his predictions on what will be announced and what he's excited for.</p>
<p>Finally Stan gives Jon a hard time for still not having a ladder.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan was late to recording for the first time ever. Turns out he was installing a Ring doorbell. He has some other home improvement projects in store for this week.</p>
<p>We talked about Jon's 30th birthday last week but it turns out the festivities weren't over yet. Jon's wife Anna was sneaky and pulled off yet another surprise party for which Stan made it back to Iowa. Stan said that the whole thing confirmed what he already knew - that I have really good taste in friends.</p>
<p>Jon's good friend Andrew flew all the way in from Irvine, CA. But more importantly - he changed Stan's life by introducing him to the best way to make bacon - the Makin' Bacon Microwave Bacon Rack. Needless to say, Stan is pretty excited about this thing.</p>
<p>This leads into Jon admitting that he's anti-microwave.</p>
<p>From there they move on to the things Jon planned to talk about including following up on the email newsletter discussion last week.</p>
<p>The White House has a new tool for reporting bias in social media posts. Turns out this &quot;tool&quot; is a Typeform. Jon thinks that it's more of a marketing play.</p>
<p>Turns out that Apple announced new MacBook Pros. Stan talks through the specs on the new machines.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Jon turned 30! Hear about his 30th birthday and Stan feeling old. You can still give him the gift of a 5 star review on iTunes.</p>
<p>Sunday was also Mother's Day. By request of Angie who works in the same building as Jon, we talk about what we did for our Mother's on Sunday.</p>
<p>We have a new written review on iTunes! Danchez from Iowa gives a glowing review, complete with making fun of the hosts. Check it out and write your own! In the meantime we're here for your enjoyment Danchez.</p>
<p>The adventures of a new home owner continues with Stan and Jon talking about Lawn care and Jon's new lawn tools.</p>
<p>Do people still read email newsletters? Stan wants to know. We also reminisce about Google Reader.</p>
<p>That leads into the current book that Stan is reading: Team of Rivals. Stan highly recommends this book about Lincoln and the building of his cabinet.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We're back to our normal studios with the normal people. We kick off the episode with a throwback to the Grilled Cheese Episode and how it's still causing controversy. This also leads into discussion on mayo and burger toppings.</p>
<p>In a previous episode Jon mentioned that Stan is his only friend and lamented how he lives in Indianapolis. Turns out that's not true. Jon has friends in Iowa one of whom left a review of the podcast on iTunes.</p>
<p>Because we've been on a Marvel kick we briefly touch on the new Spider-Man: Far from Home trailer. We're excited for the movie, but not as excited as we were for Endgame.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening. If you leave a review we'll read it on air. And send stickers!</p>

<p>This is the week! Jon is currently in Indianapolis. We're excited for Endgame. It's finally here!</p>
<p>Stan is paying attention to baseball again. At least currently because the Pirates have the best record in the National league.</p>
<p>We talk through how we would rank the movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>

<p>This week we kick off the episode explaining why we were recording early again. For both Game of Thrones and because it's Holy Week.</p>
<p>Disney rebased some big announcements that we give our take on. We're both excited for Disney+ and the content to come with it.</p>
<p>Which leads directly into the Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker teaser discussion. We have a new hope after this teaser.</p>
<p>Finally Jon asks Stan about his new investing strategy and Stan gives us more information than we could have ever dreamed of.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening in!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Happy 40th episode! (Depending on how you count.) We're also celebrating 1 year of Stan and the Lemon family in his house. Stan offers his advice for someone who's only been in a new house for half the time he's been in his.</p>
<p>Stan is back on the bicycle! His bike is all tuned up and he's working on getting his endurance back up. Jon crossed the 1000 mile mark on the bike that he got last year.</p>
<p>Stan also returned to his hobby of grilling. He grilled up his chicken tacos which is one of Jon's favorite recipes. Stan is also considering purchasing a smoker.</p>
<p>One of the core tenants of the podcast is Milkshakes. When Jon ran into a Milkshake IPA, he couldn't pass up the opportunity to try it.</p>
<p>Finally we have some Technology updates from this year. Jon talks about his experiences with Dark Sky and Mint.</p>
<p>Stan talks a little bit about Google and why he actively avoids using Google products.</p>
<p>Thanks for Listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Moving on - Stan's wifi woes are over thanks to plugin in his own router (rather than the ISPs).</p>
<p>We kick this week's episode off with a retraction of stupid things Stan said. We're pretty unplugged, not a lot of practice, not a lot of editing. So Stan issues an apology for some of the things he said last week.</p>
<p>We got some bad intel from our good friend Patrick Sturdivant on when Avengers: Endgame tickets would be available. Turns out the bad intel came from Reddit. All the more reason that any less-than-five stars reviews are perfectly at home on Reddit.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more info leading up to Endgame and whether or not Pr. Borghardt decides to come.</p>
<p>Apple released a bunch of stuff via Press Release, when the live event was scheduled for the following week. We talk through the new hardware and will follow up on the Event next week.</p>
<p>Finally we leave you with a PSA to make sure that your data is backed up.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan is very upset and very opinionated on Grilled Cheese. So we spend some time following up.</p>
<p>Next up we have two new iTunes reviews bringing us to a total of 11! Thanks friends.</p>
<p>Jon learned some valuable lessons on digital marketing by boosting their first post on Facebook. Listen in to hear about lessons learned.</p>
<p>We've started a Milkshake movement.. so milkshake reviews probably aren't over with just yet.</p>
<p>Somehow that leads in to Pokemon.. card game, PokemonGo, animated series and more.</p>
<p>We almost make it through the episode without mentioning the new Avengers trailer! Jon catches it and we talk through the trailer before signing off for this week.</p>
<p>Listen at your own risk. Leave a review.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week we talk about movie theaters, and follow up on the remainder of Stan's Iowa trip.</p>
<p>First up, we have a philosophical debate on melts vs. Grilled Cheese. We stopped at City Melt for lunch one day. They have delicious sandwhiches no matter what you call them. We had the piggy and the Buffalo chicken… Stan just has a problem calling them grilled cheese.</p>
<p>Next up we have some sad news. We stopped at the Hamburg Inn No. 2. The milkshake that wasn't that helped to kick off one of our key tenants being Milkshakes. We made it there when Stan was in town. Overall the report doesn't live up to the hype.</p>
<p>Is this the end of milkshake reviews?</p>
<p>Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Finally the recap some other things from Stan's trip including home improvement, and cocktails.</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We're back with a special bonus round episode of Life with a Twist of Lemon. We cover one of the core tenants of the podcast (Milkshakes, Mac, Marvel, and Money) by our review episode on the latest in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - Captain Marvel!</p>
<p>This episode is full of spoilers so if you don't want us to ruin the film for you, you should take this time to leave us a review on iTunes and check back after you see Captain Marvel. More importantly it is full of geekiness, so you don't want to miss this episode if you're a Marvel fan.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we think you should watch this (or watch it again.) And we're even more excited for Avengers: End Game next month.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week Stan and Jon are recording from the same room for the first time ever. Stan made it to Cedar Rapids for the weekend.</p>
<p>Stan talks about what we've done so far in Iowa including a trip to the Almost Famous Popcorn shop. Stan wasn't overly impressed with his Cookie dough Milkshake.</p>
<p>Spoilers for next week - we'll be taking a trip to the Hamburg Inn 02.</p>
<p>Stan also goes on a rant about &quot;The Customer is always right.&quot;</p>
<p>Other Iowa adventures included Jon playing bartender for Stan, pork tenderloins, eating Mexican food, and a trip to Lowes.</p>
<p>We'll talk more about Stan's Iowa visit next week. Until then - stay sour!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan had 2 milkshakes this week. Bringing our total milkshake reviews up to 3 in 2019. Listen in to hear what he thought about Potbelly's and Oberweis's takes on milkshakes. We also found what could be a milkshake abomination, but we haven't tried it yet. (Sorry Crusade Burger).</p>
<p>If you were stranded on a desert island and you could only take one country music album, what would it be? Jon and Stan weigh in. We want to hear what your album would be. Leave a comment on Facebook!</p>
<p>Jon got his snow blower and was ready to go for the impending snow storm.</p>
<p>Finally we talk about Amazon HQ2 bailing on New York. Stan and Jon weigh in.</p>
<p>We touch on resumes a little bit to keep our promise form last episode.</p>
<p>Grab a milkshake and listen in!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Winter is not over yet. Jon spent nearly 2 hours shoveling after the most recent snow storm. Stan asks Jon about snow removal tools and discovers that he finally ordered a snowblower! Somewhere in there we go off on a tangent on Star Trek.</p>
<p>All weekend Stan was tweeting about the Alliance. Jon learns that this isn't a World of Warcraft or Firefly reference.. but just more football. Needless to say, Stan is really excited about it.</p>
<p>We talk about twitter and whether it's a good platform to have a conversation/interview. #KaraJack.</p>
<p>Leave a review on iTunes. We'll read it on air and if you send Stan your address we'll send a sticker!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>

<p>Stan and Jon reflect on the Super Bowl that Jon didn't watch. Jon is happy that now everyone thinks that football is as boring as he thought for years.</p>
<p>National Pizza day is Saturday February 9th. You'll want to listen to this discussion to learn Stan's secrets to delicious pizza.</p>
<p>Finally, this week Jon listened to Weezer and convinced Stan to listen as well. We talk the Blue Album and the Teal album.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>
<p>P.S. - Jon's audio quality is terrible. We'll get it fixed.</p>
<p>&quot;You don't have to listen to the show to leave a review. You don't have to listen to the show to give it 5 stars. In fact, if you don't listen you're more likely to give it 5 stars!&quot; - Stanley C. Lemon.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>No… this episode wasn't recorded when Stan came to visit Jon because it didn't happen. Stan was hit by the plague and is currently in recovery mode. In person milkshake reviews will have to wait for another episode.</p>
<p>Much of the United States was hit with a polar vortex. It's cold. After getting lots of snow so far this year. So that is the topic of our conversation this week. Stan and Jon talk weather and whether Jon should finally purchase a snow blower and reclaim some of his time.</p>
<p>That leads into a discussion of weather apps and what Stan uses and what he would recommend. Overall consensus is that Dark Sky is a great app.</p>
<p>Listen in. Stay Warm. And we'll be back with another Twist of Lemon next week.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening. Review us on iTunes and we'll read your review on air!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Today's episode kicks off with some follow-up by Stan on what he found to track his time when on his laptop. It seems promising so far.</p>
<p>The rest of the episode was sparked by a tweak about advice to new software Developers. Stan replied: &quot;Time management. Work when you work, but don’t over work. When I was new I kept absurdly long days, sometimes worked on the weekend and was always connected by email. I’m a better engineer now that I manage time boundaries for myself.&quot;</p>
<p>This leads into what exactly he means and concrete takeaways from what we've learned through our career paths and some mistakes we've made along the way.</p>
<p>This episode feels a little different than some of our other ones. Mostly because Jon was really interested in learning everything he can from Stan.</p>
<p>Listen in, let us know what you think!</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>

<p>Stan also repents of his disparaging of Apple with the Screen Time bug. He's been working with Apple Support and has had an overall great experience. The problem isn't solved yet, but things sound promising. Customer Support may not be completely dead in the Tech industry!</p>
<p>Netflix prices are going up again. Between that and canceling Marvel shows will Jon stick with them? Stan gives us an update on his watching.</p>
<p>Solo was released on Netflix - Jon finally watched it. The first Star Wars film that has come out since Jon has been born that he didn't see in Theaters. We spend some time talking about what we liked and didn't like in Solo and some other recent Star Wars movies.</p>
<p>To round it all out Stan gives Jon a hard time about Facebook and his superior trivia knowledge.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening. If you like what you hear leave us a review on iTunes!</p>
<p>Stan Lemon &amp; Jon Kohlmeier</p>

<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Stan got a milkshake from Red Robin this week. It went about how you'd expect it to go. We also hit on some other things around Red Robin. We also discovered that there is a Strawberry Milkshake flavored Pop-Tart. Stay tuned for reviews of that.</p>
<p>Coming off of our sugar high, Stan tells us about his most recent iOS woes. He's running into trouble locking down screen time for his children's devices.</p>
<p>That leads into Adult Screen-time and what Stan has been trying to rush through so he doesn't have to pay for another month of Netflix.</p>
<p>Finally we each go through our Top 5 of 2018. Some items include buying houses, starting a podcast, and travel.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening in. We're still waiting for our first written iTunes review of 2019!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We're back from holiday celebrations and ready to tackle the new year.</p>
<p>Over the holiday, Jon got the comment &quot;The purple thing is weird.&quot; in regards to our logo color / sticker color. The color is not purple! It's very specifically lilac. Stan reveals the lilac story in this episode.</p>
<p>Stan thought the best way to start off the new year was with a budget episode. Jon and Stan talk through their normal monthly budget process and how they keep track of expenses.</p>
<p>We dive into, how we handle income and allocate it, the tools we use to keep track of where we're at at any given time in the month and how we handle checks that we've written.</p>
<p>To wrap up the conversation we provide some tips on getting started with budgeting.</p>
<p>Listen in and feel free to <a href="https://twistoflemonpod.com/contact/">send us questions</a>.</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>

<p>We're only $100 dollars away from reaching our goal in support of Pastor Fritsche.</p>
<p>Next up, Stan and Jon talk about New Years Resolutions. Neither are resolution purists but set certain goals and try to cultivate habits.</p>
<p>This week we also find out that Stan and Jon have significantly different ideas around what should appear on an iPhone home screen.</p>
<p>That leads into a discussion on note taking apps and task list apps.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We are just days away from Christmas, Stan and Jon kick off the episode talking about Christmas leading into a special Christmas themed milkshake segment - &quot;Egg nog - milkshake? Distant cousin of the milkshake?&quot;</p>
<p>That leads into a real milkshake segment! Both Stan and Jon returned to their places featuring the Chocolate Shoppe Ice cream. Jon's ice cream choice was much better at Almost Famous Popcorn. Stan also revisited Wylipalooza.</p>
<p>Finally, Stan and Jon discuss the Avengers: Endgame trailer, focusing a lot on the character development of Tony Stark throughout the franchise.</p>
<p>We are only $150 away from reaching our goal in support of Pastor Fritsche. Stan will match any donations up to our goal.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>This week Stan kicks off the episode by asking Jon if he's started listening to Christmas music yet.</p>
<p>If you've been paying attention to our Facebook or Twitter account you'll know that Jon was in Nashville. He talks about his experience with WordCamp US and some of the fun that he had in Nashville.</p>
<p>Big take away from Nashville Hot Chicken and the current #1 milkshake on Jon's list from Elliston Place Soda Shop.</p>
<p>Enjoy some photos, below!</p>
<p>This is probably where we should have stopped for time sake, but you'll get a longer edition of LWaToL this time around.</p>
<p>Stan and Jon talk about Grills so Jon can decide what kind of Grill he wants to get.</p>
<p>Finally, we're over halfway to our goal for support to Pastor Fritsche. Thanks for those who have supported so far. Let's reach $1000 before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Faithful Listener,</p>
<p>Today Jon's audio quality is a little deteriorated due to recording at home. Why is he at home and not in Studio? The joys of home ownership. Listen in to hear Jon's first fix as a homeowner.</p>
<p>Next up, Stan has 2 reviews on milkshakes. First a milkshake from the Atlanta airport based on a recommendation. He doesn't have a great review of it.</p>
<p>Next he returned to the scene of the original good Five Guys milkshake. This visit isn't up to par.</p>
<p>Milkshake quality depends on craftsmanship and employees taking pride in their work.</p>
<p>We got a couple more iTunes reviews that we want to shout out to. Thanks for listening and taking time to leave feedback. We really appreciate it!</p>
<p>After a quick update on the donate to Pastor Fritsche campaign, Stan and Jon talk meatloaf.</p>
<p>They even decide what they'll talk about next week while on air.</p>
<p>Donate to Fritsche, let us know. You'll want to read the letter that comes with the sticker.</p>
<p>Talk next week,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We have an exciting campaign going on during the month of December. We're looking to support Pastor Joel Fritsche and his work in the Dominican Republic. Here's the deal, you donate - send us proof of donating $50 or more and we'll send you a limited edition Life with a Twist of Lemon sticker (3&quot; x 3&quot;).</p>
<p>Even better is Stan will be matching the first $1000 raised.</p>
<p>Listen in to hear about the work of Pastor Fritsche with the seminary in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>From there Stan has *another* beef with CPH study notes. He rants a little bit. I apologize to our non-LCMS listeners for the inside baseball. Jon calls people out by name... overall it's a bitter segment. You can skip it if you'd like. (Props to CPH for no more red algae).</p>
<p>Finally we switch gears to Tech. Stan quit Gmail this week. We talk about Google, security and the evolution of correspondence and email.</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in and we hope to be sending you a sticker soon!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>You can measure short distances on Google Maps! That tip alone is worth listening to this episode.</p>
<p>A new Italian Beef place opened up in Cedar Rapids, I give my review (unfortunately no milkshakes on the menu). Stan describes what an Italian beef is, because apparently they're kind of a regional thing.</p>
<p>Stan Lee died this week, we remember the creator of Marvel and spend some time talking about his work.</p>
<p>I voted... and started more political talk. The episode is saved with a Jon Moving Update. Stan is surviving life and the Lemon house doesn't appear to be falling apart this week.</p>
<p>Listen in, have fun, write a review on iTunes: we'll be talking about some on air next week!</p>
<p>Talk to you later,</p>

<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>As of this episode you may be listening on Spotify!</p>
<p>Following up on last episode's discussion, Stan tells us about his Reformation service experience. Jesus Christ is the light of the World and Stan's church made it through 1/3 of the service with only candlelight and a cappella singing.</p>
<p>Due to busy schedules, we recorded earlier than expected so no real time election followup. We're all ready for the advertisements and the discussions to end. Stan tells me why voting is a civic duty and makes a good case for me to go and vote.</p>
<p>Now that everyone is depressed by political discussions, we can go back to Marvel, milkshakes, and my home buying process. Stan call me out on creating a Kanban board to manage the packing and moving process (See <a href="https://facebook.com/twistoflemonpod">Facebook</a> for a picture). Check in to see how Anna is dealing with this all. You may see a blog post on this when I have time to sit down and write one.</p>
<p>Stan also bought some Crypto this week.. we'll see how that goes.</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in, thanks for those of you who have written reviews on iTunes! We have some exciting stuff coming soon.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Good news - No bad reviews on Reddit yet!</p>
<p>Why did we skip trick or treating to go to a church service? We talk through some reasons in this episode. The big reason ends up being the hymns. (You might even catch Jon singing.) Bottom line is good hymns trump candy.</p>
<p>In light of next week's elections, Jon asks Stan how he reasons out who to vote for.</p>
<p>After that downer - Jon has a milkshake review from Freddy's Frozen Custard.</p>
<p>Apple announced new hardware for the iPad Pro, Mac mini, and MacBook Air. Did Stan order anything? Why or why not?</p>
<p>Listen in, rate us (5 stars) on iTunes, post any complaints on Reddit and we'll talk to you next week!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>If you're sick of milkshake talk skip the first 3.5 minutes. From there we rejoice in our first iTunes written review AND the first great mystery of Life with a Twist of Lemon.</p>
<p>Jon used the Meat Rubs by Fenker that he received in the mail and gives his review.</p>
<p>Bad news for Netflix / Marvel Fans. Stan and Jon discuss the cancellation of Luke Cage and Iron Fist.</p>
<p>Jon gives an update on the House Hunt.</p>
<p>Finally - Stan suggests a book for Jon to read: &quot;Creative Selection.&quot; A book that Stan says is one of the best books in technology. Jon also wants to make a look at &quot;It doesn't have to be crazy at work.&quot;</p>
<p>Thanks for listening - leave a review and we just might talk about you too!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>We have a sweeter Lemon join us at the beginning of this episode. Lucy tells us about her milkshake experience which leads into even more milkshake talk. Surprisingly they had very similar milkshakes. Those of you in the Indianapolis area should check out <a href="http://wyliepalooza.com">Wyliepalooza</a>. If you're in Cedar Rapids be sure to check out <a href="https://www.almostfamouspopcorn.com">Almost Famous Popcorn</a>.</p>
<p>If you're sick of listening to us talk about Milkshakes and would like to do something more productive with your time skip to around the 19 minute mark. At the request of our listener Jeff, we talk about how our days look and how we seemingly get so much done in a day.</p>
<p>We think the key to productivity is trimming the waste. Jon and Stan have somewhat different takes on the matter. Listen in to how they tackle their ToDos.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening, If you like what you hear - please leave us a 5-star review on iTunes.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Today we kick off the episode arguing semantics. Stan has yet another milkshake story. He attends a place with &quot;Shake&quot; in the name and is underwhelmed.</p>
<p>Regular listener Tom, sent us an article via twitter for our (read: Stan's) opinion. Hear us opine on the lockdown of Apple repairs.</p>
<p>This leads to a broader discussion on security and data privacy of all kinds.</p>
<p>Stan checks in on the Kohlmeier home buying adventure which leads into a discussion on 30 year vs 15 year mortgage.</p>
<p>If you like what you hear, leave us a review on iTunes.</p>

<p>I'm not even really sure where to start for this episode. We cover a plethora of topics from tech to food, to reading non-fiction. You're sure to find something that interests you in this episode (even if it only is the soothing sound of The Lemon's voice) Maybe it will be easier if I just list some of the topics out.</p>
<ul>
<li>New recording settings</li>
<li>Milkshakes (of course)</li>
<li>Apple Activity</li>
<li>Meat, Rubbed and Salutary</li>
<li>Recipes</li>
<li>Killer iOS feature - Password manager.</li>
<li>Screen time and tactics to use phone less.</li>
<li>Reading Non-fiction books</li>
<li>Apollo 8</li>
<li>Art of Manliness episodes</li>
<li>The Great Books</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy the show!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>In this episode, Stan Lemon reviews Meat Rubs by Fenker (or.. Meat, Rubbed, and Salutary - branding pending.) Stan gives a good review but the only way to get them are to be friends with Rev. Aaron Fenker.</p>
<p>Stan got new Apple Gear, much of the world got new apple software, listen in for our discussion on that.</p>
<p>Milkshakes appeared, of course. You can hear a tale of two Five Guys milkshakes.</p>
<p>And to wrap it all up we get to what we planned to talk about. Investing 101. We talk saving strategies and basic investing.</p>
<p>If that doesn't give you a good idea of what life with a Twist of Lemon is... I don't know what will.</p>
<p>Thanks for sticking with us!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>The story of this week's episode is that Jon had a simple question for Stan that he texted on a Sunday evening after a google search failed him. The question went something like this: &quot;Top ten things to look at when your Realtor shows you houses.... go!&quot; I (Jon) expected a list! 10 Things! But there's no such thing as a simple question when it comes to Stan. He convinces me to dig up the secondary microphone in the home office and record after 8pm on a Sunday night.</p>
<p>I think we hit 10 things. I guess that I'll go back and listen again and see if I can't turn it into a text list. If you get to it before me feel free to send them via message on our <a href="https://facebook.com/twistoflemonpod">Facebook Page</a>.</p>
<p>We do review milkshakes from Arby's and Five Guys. Stan also attempted A &amp; W. So stick around for you weekly milkshake update.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Financially Minded Listener,</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in for Episode 8! This week Jon met his mortgage savings goal so he seeks advice from the most experienced guy he knows - Stan Lemon (who has gone through the process 6 times.) Stan drops some knowledge and points out some mistakes he's made in the past. Listen in and you just might learn something!</p>
<p>The cohosts both failed to complete our Milkshake homework so the milkshake followup will have to wait for another episode.</p>
<p>Pay no attention to the lawnmower background noise. We're still amateurs who don't have nice sound proof studios. (Sorry Gillespie.)</p>
<p>We'll be back next week,</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jon Kohlmeier &amp; Stan Lemon</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>If you want to hear us talk about milkshakes for an abnormal amount of time, you won't want to miss this episode! Stan kicks off the episode talking about his day trip to Fort Wayne and how there are now places to eat. We follow up on our milkshake discussion with some milkshake recommendations and milkshakes to avoid. Finally the Lemon turns sour and lets out his anger against Twitter and their killing of his favorite Twitter apps.</p>
<p>As a bonus you'll hear about Jon's new Mac, Stan's first experience watching the Lord of the Rings films, Baby Got Brunch, and more!</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy and share this episode with anyone you think might find it interested.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dear Listener,</p>
<p>Thanks for tuning in again week!</p>
<p>In Episode 6 of Life with a Twist of Lemon, Stan tells us about his trip to Atlanta for work. He has Jon salivating over some of the food he found and looking up plane tickets to head to Atlanta.</p>
<p>All of that somehow leads into Jon's new Amazon Echo, the greatest trivia device ever... but at what cost? From there they go down the trail of home automation, current smart devices and future plans. (Stan will probably keep just using Alexa as a fancy timer.)</p>
<p>Let us know what else we should use our home assistants for on social media.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>LWaToL Hosts</p>

<p>If you haven't seen the movie and don't care about spoilers, listen in for the MCU insights.</p>
<p>Thanks for listening!</p>
