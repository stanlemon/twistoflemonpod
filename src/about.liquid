      <p>Life with a Twist of Lemon started the same way a lot of good things do: two friends on the phone talking about the latest MacBook news and thinking other people might enjoy the conversation.</p>
      <p>Jon and Stan first connected in 2005. Stan says Jon cyber-stalked him. Jon started volunteering for an organization Stan worked with, then took on more responsibility and eventually reported to him. Along the way, Stan showed Jon the ropes of web development, productivity, and how to be a good employee.</p>
      <p>They have been friends ever since. The show is their standing catch-up with microphones. Technology, productivity, personal finance, milkshakes, Marvel movies, and whatever else is top of mind. After a four-year hiatus, they are back in 2025. A lot has changed and a lot has stayed the same. AI is part of life now. They both own Apple Vision Pros. Stan describes Jon’s work simply: he makes people successful.</p>
